# 6.824 2015 年第 20 讲：Argus

**注意：**这些讲义内容稍作修改，来自 6.824 [课程网站](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/schedule.html) 2015 年春季的帖子。

## 原子提交：两阶段提交

+   如何使用两阶段提交处理分布式事务

+   Argus

你有一堆做不同事情的计算机（不是副本）。就像两台计算机，一台存储 A-L 的人的事件，另一台存储 M-Z 的人的事件。如果你想为 Alice 和 Mike 创建一个事件，你需要与两个服务器进行交互，并确保事件要么同时创建在两个服务器上，要么都不创建。

挑战在于 *崩溃* 和 *网络故障* 会引入不确定性（由于崩溃或网络故障而不响应引起的问题？）

在 Ivy 和 TreadMarks 中，如果其中一台机器崩溃，它将无法恢复。我们还看到了 MapReduce 和 Spark，它们对崩溃恢复有一套处理机制。

代码：

```
schedule(u1 user, u2 user, t time):
    ok1 = reserve(u1, t)    # reserve for the 1st user
    ok2 = reserve(u2, t)    # reserve for the 2nd user

    # Tricky: if the 1st reserve succeeded and the 2nd didn't => trouble
    # We'd like to deal with this in the following way:

    if ok1 and ok2
        commit
    else
        abort

    # One bad way to make this work is to let the servers chit-chat and
    # make sure they both committed.
    # At no stage in a transaction like this can the servers finish
    #   - S1: I'll do it if you do it
    #   - S2: I'll do it if you do it
    #   - S1: I'll do it if you do it
    #   - S2: I'll do it if you do it
    # (sounds like the two generals problem?) 
```

### 想法 1：临时更改

```
reserve(u user, t time):
    if u[t] = free          # if user's calendar is free at time t
        tent[t] = taken     # ...then tenatively schedule
commit:
    copy tent[t] to u[t]
abort:
    discard tent[t] 
```

### 想法 2：单台机器/实体（事务协调器）决定

```
client           TC      A       B
    \-------------------->
    \---------------------------->
                         |       |
    <--------------------/       |
    <----------------------------/
                    ------------
    ----- GO ----> |            |
                 | |            |
    <------------/ |            |
                    ------------ 
```

特性：

+   状态：未知、已提交、已中止

+   如果任何人认为 "已提交"，则没有人认为 "已中止"

+   如果任何人认为 "已中止"，则没有人认为 "已提交"

## 两阶段提交（2PC）

在真实的分布式数据库中经常使用。

```
client          TC          A           B
                    .
                    .
                    .
    ---- GO ---->                             --\
                   prepare                      |
                ------------>                   |
                ------------------------>       | Phase 1
                   yes/no   |           |       |
                <-----------/           |       |
                <-----------------------/     --/

                   commit/abort
                ------------>                 --\
                ------------------------>       | Phase 2
    commit/abort                                |
  <-------------                              --/ 
```

`准备` 询问 "你还活着并愿意提交此事务吗？"

+   服务器可能会拒绝

+   服务器可能无法访问

### 终止协议

+   或许 TC 在等待一个或多个准备消息的确认时有一个超时

    +   此时，它可以中止事务，因为没有人开始提交（因为 TC 没有发送，因为它在等待是/否）

+   B 在等待准备消息时超时

    +   `=>` B 没有回复准备 `=>` TC 没有向参与者发送提交 `=>` TC 可以发送中止

+   在拒绝准备后，B 在等待提交/中止时超时

    +   `=>` B 可以中止，因为它知道 TC 将会中止所有人

+   在同意准备后，B 在等待提交/中止时超时

    +   `=>` B 对 TC 说了是，而 TC 可能已经收到了其他人的 `是`（或没有） `=>` 结果可以是提交或中止 `=>` B 必须等待

    +   在某些幸运的情况下，如果 `A` 通过另一个信道告诉 `B`，`B` 可能会决定中止/提交

这种等待会使得 2PC 不切实际吗？人们意见分歧？

重启怎么办？如果参与者之一对准备说了是，那么它必须跨重启或崩溃记住，以便能够完成事务（提交或中止）。

+   在日历示例中，它还需要记住 `tent[]` 中的临时时间表

+   额外说明：因为在图表中 TC 没有等待提交/中止的 ACK，参与者需要在事务周围保持其锁，以便在此事务完成之前不执行后续事务

如果 TC 在发送提交过程中崩溃会发生什么？

+   它必须记住所有已提交/未提交的事务

与 Paxos 有相似之处吗？

+   Paxos 是通过复制构建高可用系统的一种方式（所有服务器都拥有所有数据并执行相同的操作）。

    +   即使一些服务器宕机，Paxos 系统也可以继续运行

+   即使只有一个服务器宕机，2PC 也无法取得进展

    +   每个服务器都在执行*不同的操作*（希望每个服务器在事务中执行自己的部分）

+   虽然 2PC 帮助一组服务器达成一致，但它不具备容错性或可用性（当服务器宕机时无法继续进行）。

+   你可能认为可以通过 Paxos 来进行日历调度，让两个服务器就日程安排达成一致。然而，虽然就操作达成一致是可行的，但提交操作却不行。例如，如果一个服务器的用户在预定时间忙碌，那么它无法提交操作，而另一个可能可以。Paxos 无法解决这种冲突。

原子分布式事务：编写事务代码时不考虑其他可能正在进行的事务。

银行示例：

```
T1:
    addToBal(x, 1)
    addToBal(y, -1)

    # Need this to be a transaction to implement a transfer correctly

T2:
    tmp1 = getBal(x)
    tmp2 = getBal(y)

    print(tmp1, tmp2)

    # We cannot have the execution of T1 interleave with the execution of
    # T2\. T2 had better see both addToBal calls or no addToBal calls from T1 
```

这被称为*可串行性*：运行一系列事务的效果与它们按某种顺序运行的效果相同（不允许交错：执行 T1 的前半部分，执行 T2 的前半部分，完成 T1 的后半部分，完成 T2）。

实现事务的一种方式是在事务开始操作这些记录之前获取每个数据记录的锁，并在提交或中止之前一直持有这些锁。这被称为**两阶段锁定**。

如果 T1 先获取 x 然后获取 y，而 T2 先获取 y 然后获取 x，就会发生死锁。例如，数据库系统有处理这种情况的方法：

+   在获取锁时设置超时并重试

+   只允许事务按特定顺序获取锁

+   如果是单机设置，则执行死锁检测

没有人喜欢使用 2PC。

+   当服务器在准备阶段回复“否”后超时等待提交/中止时，会出现等待/阻塞问题。

当参与者获取锁时，它们在网络中跨越多个 RTT 持有这些锁，因为你必须等待提交消息。

## Argus

+   令人兴奋的是，它试图将分布式系统编程的许多细节混杂在语言内部

+   期望是为处理 RPC 失败提供一个清晰的解决方案。

+   Argus 建立了一个框架，可以清晰地处理 RPC 失败。

    +   执行所有必要的工作以回滚事务

+   Argus 必须了解数据才能进行回滚操作。

    +   它需要创建临时更新等等

# 6.824 笔记

```
6.824 2015 Lecture 20: Two-Phase Commmit

Topics:
  distributed commit, two-phase commit
  distributed transactions
  Argus -- language for distributed programming

Distributed commit:
  A bunch of computers are cooperating on some task, e.g. bank transfer
  Each computer has a different role, e.g. src and dst bank account
  Want to ensure atomicity: all execute, or none execute
    "distributed transaction"
  Challenges: crashes and network failures

Example:
  calendar system, each user has a calendar
  want to schedule meetings with multiple participants
  one server holds calendars of users A-M, another server holds N-Z
  [diagram: client, two servers]
  sched(u1, u2, t):
    begin_transaction
      ok1 = reserve(u1, t)
      ok2 = reserve(u2, t)
      if ok1 and ok2:
        commit
      else
        abort
    end_transaction
  the reserve() calls are RPCs to the two calendar servers
  We want both to reserve, or both not to reserve.
  What if 1st reserve() returns true, and then:
    2nd reserve() returns false (time not available)
    2nd reserve() doesn't return (lost RPC msg, u2's server crashes)
    2nd reserve() returns but then crashes
    client fails before 2nd reserve()
  We need a "distributed commit protocol"

Idea: tentative changes, later commit or undo (abort)
  reserve_handler(u, t):
    if u[t] is free:
      temp_u[t] = taken -- A TEMPORARY VERSION
      return true
    else:
      return false
  commit_handler():
    copy temp_u[t] to real u[t]
  abort_handler():
    discard temp_u[t]

Idea: single entity decides whether to commit
  to prevent any chance of disagreement
  let's call it the Transaction Coordinator (TC)
  [time diagram: client, TC, A, B]
  client sends RPCs to A, B
  on end_transaction, client sends "go" to TC
  TC/A/B execute distributed commit protocol...
  TC reports "commit" or "abort" to client

We want two properties for distributed commit protocol:
  TC, A, and B start in state "unknown"
    each can move to state "abort" or "commit"
    but then each never changes mind
  Correctness:
    if any commit, none abort
    if any abort, none commit
  Performance:
    (since doing nothing is correct...)
    if no failures, and A and B can commit, then commit.
    if failures, come to some conclusion ASAP.

We're going to develop a protocol called "two-phase commit"
  Used by distributed databases for multi-server transactions
  And by Spanner and Argus

Two-phase commit without failures:
  [time diagram: client, TC, A, B]
  client sends reserve() RPCs to A, B
  client sends "go" to TC
  TC sends "prepare" messages to A and B.
  A and B respond, saying whether they're willing to commit.
    Respond "yes" if haven't crashed, timed out, &c.
  If both say "yes", TC sends "commit" messages.
  If either says "no", TC sends "abort" messages.
  A/B "decide to commit" if they get a commit message.
    I.e. they actually modify the user's calendar.

Why is this correct so far?
  Neither can commit unless they both agreed.
  Crucial that neither changes mind after responding to prepare
    Not even if failure

What about failures?
  Network broken/lossy
  Server crashes
  Both visible as timeout when expecting a message.

Where do hosts wait for messages?
  1) TC waits for yes/no.
  2) A and B wait for prepare and commit/abort.

Termination protocol summary:
  TC t/o for yes/no -> abort
  B t/o for prepare, -> abort
  B t/o for commit/abort, B voted no -> abort
  B t/o for commit/abort, B voted yes -> block

TC timeout while waiting for yes/no from A/B.
  TC has not sent any "commit" messages.
  So TC can safely abort, and send "abort" messages.

A/B timeout while waiting for prepare from TC
  have not yet responded to prepare
  so can abort
  respond "no" to future prepare

A/B timeout while waiting for commit/abort from TC.
  Let's talk about just B (A is symmetric).
  If B voted "no", it can unilaterally abort.
  So what if B voted "yes"?
  Can B unilaterally decide to abort?
    No! TC might have gotten "yes" from both,
    and sent out "commit" to A, but crashed before sending to B.
    So then A would commit and B would abort: incorrect.
  B can't unilaterally commit, either:
    A might have voted "no".

If B voted "yes", it must "block": wait for TC decision.

What if B crashes and restarts?
  If B sent "yes" before crash, B must remember!
    --- this is today's question
  Can't change to "no" (and thus abort) after restart
  Since TC may have seen previous yes and told A to commit
  Thus:
    B must remember on disk before saying "yes", including modified data.
    B reboots, disk says "yes" but no "commit", must ask TC.
    If TC says "commit", copy modified data to real data.

What if TC crashes and restarts?
  If TC might have sent "commit" or "abort" before crash, TC must remember!
    And repeat that if anyone asks (i.e. if A/B/client didn't get msg).
    Thus TC must write "commit" to disk before sending commit msgs.
  Can't change mind since A/B/client have already acted.

This protocol is called "two-phase commit".
  What properties does it have?
  * All hosts that decide reach the same decision.
  * No commit unless everyone says "yes".
  * TC failure can make servers block until repair.

What about concurrent transactions?
  We realy want atomic distributed transactions,
    not just single atomic commit.
  x and y are bank balances
  x and y start out as $10
  T1 is doing a transfer of $1 from x to y
  T1:
    add(x, 1)  -- server A
    add(y, -1) -- server B
  T2:
    tmp1 = get(x)
    tmp2 = get(y)
    print tmp1, tmp2

Problem:
  what if T2 runs between the two add() RPCs?
  then T2 will print 11, 10
  money will have been created!
  T2 should print 10,10 or 9,11

The traditional approach is to provide "serializability"
  results should be as if transactions ran one at a time in some order
  either T1, then T2; or T2, then T1

Why serializability?
  it allows transaction code to ignore the possibility of concurrency
  just write the transaction to take system from one legal state to another
  internally, the transaction can temporarily violate invariants
    but serializability guarantess no-one will notice

One way to implement serializabilty is with "two-phase locking"
  this is what Argus does
  each database record has a lock
  the lock is stored at the server that stores the record
    no need for a central lock server
  each use of a record automatically acquires the record's lock
    thus add() handler implicitly acquires lock when it uses record x or y
  locks are held until *after* commit or abort 

Why hold locks until after commit/abort?
  why not release as soon as done with the record?
  e.g. why not have T2 release x's lock after first get()?
    T1 could then execute between T2's get()s
    T2 would print 10,9
    but that is not a serializable execution: neither T1;T2 nor T2;T1

2PC perspective
  Used in sharded DBs when a transaction uses data on multiple shards
  But it has a bad reputation:
    slow because of multiple phases / message exchanges
    locks are held over the prepare/commit exchanges
    TC crash can cause indefinite blocking, with locks held
  Thus usually used only in a single small domain
    E.g. not between banks, not between airlines, not over wide area

Paxos and two-phase commit solve different problems!
  Use Paxos to high availability by replicating
    i.e. to be able to operate when some servers are crashed
    the servers must have identical state
  Use 2PC when each participant does something different
    And *all* of them must do their part
  2PC does not help availability
    since all servers must be up to get anything done
  Paxos does not ensure that all servers do something
    since only a majority have to be alive

What if you want high availability *and* distributed commit?
  [diagram]
  Each "server" should be a Paxos-replicated service
  And the TC should be Paxos-replicated
  Run two-phase commit where each participant is a replicated service
  Then you can tolerate failures and still make progress
  This is what Spanner does (for update transactions)

Case study: Argus

Argus's big ideas:
  Language support for distributed programs
    Very cool: language abstracts away ugly parts of distrib systems
    Aimed at different servers doing different jobs, cooperating
  Easy fault tolerance:
    Transactional updates
    So crash results in entire transaction un-done, not partial update
  Easy persistence ("stable"):
    Ordinary variables automatically persisted to disk
    Automatic crash recovery
  Easy concurrency:
    Implicit locking of language objects
  Easy RPC model:
    Method calls transparently turned into RPCs
    RPC failure largely hidden via transactions, two-phase commit

We've seen the fundamental problem before
  What to do if *part* of a distributed computation crashes?
  IVY/Treadmarks had no answer
  MR/Spark could re-execute *part* of computation, for big data

Picture
  "guardian" is like an RPC server
    has state (variables) and handlers
  "handler" is an RPC handler
    reads and writes local variables
  "action" is a distributed atomic transaction
  action on A
    A RPC to B
      B RPC to C
    A RPC to D
  A finishes action
    prepare msgs to B, C, D
    commit msgs to B, C, D

The style is to send RPC to where the data is
  Not to fetch the data
  Argus is not a storage system

Look at bank example
  page 309 (and 306): bank transfer

Points to notice
  stable keyword (programmer never writes to disk &c)
  atomic keyword (programmer almost never locks/unlocks)
  enter topaction (in transfer)
  coenter (in transfer)
  RPCs are hidden (e.g. f.withdraw())
  RPC error handling hidden (just aborts)

what if deposit account doesn't exist?
  but f.withdraw(from) has already been called?
  how to un-do?
  what's the guardian state when withdraw() handler returns?
    lock, temporary version, just in memory

what if an audit runs during a transfer?
  how does the audit not see the tentative new balances?

if a guardian crashes and reboots, what happens to its locks?
  can it just forget about pre-crash locks?

subactions
  each RPC is actually a sub-action
  the RPC can fail or abort w/o aborting surrounding action
  this lets actions e.g. try one server, then another
  if RPC reply lost, subaction will abort, undo
    much cleaner than e.g. Go RPC

is Argus's implicit locking the right thing?
  very convenient!
  don't have to worry about forgetting to lock!
  (though deadlocks are easy)
  databases work (and worked) this way; it's a sucessful idea

is transactions + RPC + 2PC a good design point?
  programmability pro:
    very easy to get nice fault tolerance semantics
  performance con:
    lots of msgs and disk writes
    2PC and 2PL hold locks for a while, block if failure

is Argus's language integration the right thing?
  i.e. persisting and locking language objects
  it looks very convenient (and it is)
  but it turns out to be even more valuable have relational tables
    people like queries/joins/&c over tables, rows, columns
    that is, people like a storage abstraction!
  maybe there is a better language-based scheme waiting to be found 
```
