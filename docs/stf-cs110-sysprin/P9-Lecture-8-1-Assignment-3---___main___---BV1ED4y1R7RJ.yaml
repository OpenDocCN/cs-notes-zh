- en: late and I apologize that I didn't get to it in class today。 So assignment three
    is。 as the title says， everything about multi-processing。 So you're going to have
    to do lots of multi-processing here。 Specifically。 you're going to use fork and
    exec CVP and you're going to use weight PID。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're going to use pipe and you're going to use dupe or probably dupe two
    as it turns。 out and all the different things that we've learned about in order
    to do four different， programs。 The first two are relatively minor and the third
    one and fourth one are a little bit。

- en: bigger。 So let's dig right in。 So the first assignment is pipeline。 the first
    part of the assignment is pipeline。 Now pipeline does the following。 Pipeline
    takes in two parameters that are basically command line arguments that include
    the program。 name as the first argument and then all of its arguments after that
    and then a second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: argument list that's the same thing。 So basically。 and then it takes in an array
    of PIDs which is empty when you start， this。 will be filled when the pipeline
    function returns and we'll have two PIDs in it that。 are the two PIDs for the
    two children that your pipeline is going to create。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first of which will send its standard output into the second one's standard
    input。 So what does that actually mean？ Well， what you're basically doing is you're
    setting up a system like the following。 Okay， let me pull up a terminal here and
    show you what's going on here。

- en: Okay， if you do something like the following。 Let's see。 let's just say I have
    a test file about TXT and inside it I'll put some fruit， name。 BANNA and apple
    and donut which is not a fruit at all。 And let's put in cantaloupe and so you
    have these sorts of fruits and other things in， your list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， and that is test file。 Let's say we wanted to cat test file， in other
    words printed out。 right？ And we wanted to then pipe it through sort which would
    sort the words in the list。 So what's happening here？ Well， cat is taking the
    file and inputting from the file and outputting through standard。 out， if you
    just type cat test file then it prints out to the terminal which is standard，
    out。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is important。 And then sort is taking input from standard in。 How do I
    know it's standard in？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I just type sort and start typing things， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if I type and then these are standard in and it's just accepting this。 And
    when I do control D it will actually end the input and it will sort it。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/4aaf83bd6fe015b6bc46385fddf81dff_10.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Sort it will actually sort it。 So sort is taking standard input and printing
    it to standard output and cat is taking input。 from this file as it turns out
    and printing it to standard output。 Alright。 so what does that actually mean in
    terms of your pipeline file？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you do cat test file dot txt pipe through sort the standard out of cat，
    standard out。 of cat becomes the standard in of sort。 And how do we do that？ Well，
    we have to do that via a pipe。 Okay， so you have to say basically you have to
    pipe the output of test file that our cat。 test file txt into sort。 Okay， in fact
    later in the next assignment you'll be able to do it through more pipes。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/4aaf83bd6fe015b6bc46385fddf81dff_12.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: as well。 Basically standard out of cat becomes standard in of sort。 standard
    out of sort becomes standard， in for word count。 Okay。 now pipeline is only two
    of these but that's how it works。 Okay。 now let's talk a little bit more about
    the actual pipeline itself。

- en: '![](img/4aaf83bd6fe015b6bc46385fddf81dff_14.png)'

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well， remember what pipe does。 Okay， pipe when you say FDS when you have an
    array of file descriptors basically like。 this int FDS 2， you have a 2。 And then
    you do that pipe creates two file descriptors。 FDS 0 is the reader and FDS 1 is
    the writer。 Okay。 when you write into FDS 1 you can read that text from FDS 0。
    Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now let's talk just briefly about the example we had before。 We had cat file
    test。txt or whatever it was。 Okay， well that is going to need to redirect its
    standard out。 Okay。 and then we also have the sort， right？ Well， and sort needs
    its standard in redirected。 Okay。 so basically standard， and I should do it this
    way I guess， we should say that， standard out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so basically FDS 1 which is the writer， okay， okay， needs to be kind of。 translated
    to SD standard out for file test and FDS 0 needs to be translated to SD standard。
    in for sort。 Okay， that's really all there is to it。

    the first program and one to fork the second program and up third program， in

    this case。

    4。 And by the way。 some of these numbers will be different for you than in the

    more syscalls， here。 And then finally we get a syscall 231 here that does not
    return anything and then the。 program exits。 And that should be the output of
    your trace。 Okay， so again。 trace captures all the system calls from a program

    part of assignment three is kind of a cool program called farm， which is basically。
    going to use all the cores on a particular myth machine to factor numbers for
    you。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: Take a look at this Python program。 Now the actual factoring is going to be
    done by a Python program。 You don't really need to understand Python necessarily。
    It's although it's a fairly easy program here to understand。 But basically this
    Python program checks the command line arguments and see if it's self-haulting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not。 And then it is self-haulting as it turns out when we run it。 And it
    is going to get its own PID。 And then it's going to go through this while loop。
    And in the while loop， the first thing it's going to do is it's going to stop
    itself。 In other words， it's going to pause itself to wait for input from your
    program。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's going to be a farm of all these different processes that are waiting
    for。 input from you as the coordinating process from your parent as it turns out。
    Okay。 Once your program continues this Python program， it is going to read in
    a number。 Okay。 And it's going to read the number and then start a timer immediately
    because we want a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time how long it takes to factor these。 And it's going to actually factor it。
    Then it is going to stop the timer。 And then it is going to print out the factorization。
    Okay。 And then it's going to continue back in the while loop and wait for another
    number。 Eventually you will close the input that you are sending to this Python
    program at which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: point it will close the actual Python program。 Okay。

    on the myths and spawns several what we call。 workers one for each core and then
    of the self halting factor and then sends numbers。 to that program to be factored。

    and then it should say。

    a C plus plus struct by the way so it has things。 like constructors in it。 So
    it's got a constructor that takes in an argument and the arguments for the constructor。
