    I need to change the style，attribute on this first heading up here。

    what I'd like to do is to somehow，just be able to write the style code，once and。then
    have it applied to both of these，heads and in fact there is a way to do。that what
    we can do is instead of doing，what we might call inline styling where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we can move our style code to an，entirely different part of the webpage。recall

    information that's useful to，know about the web page but isn't。

    instead of putting these，style attributes inside in line with。
  prefs: []

    where in between these the，opening style tag and the closing style。tag I can add

    happens to find inside the body，advantage，here advantage number one is what we。

    h1 elements I can write at once，and say apply this styling to all of the。H ones

    out the style code to，somewhere else just to make it a little。

    we。had not just two but maybe five or six，or seven different CSS property isn't。that

    has multiple different web，pages it's probably going to be likely。
