welcome to computer graphics 15，462-662 at carnegie mellon university。

i'm kenan crane i'm a professor of，computer science and robotics，and i also do research in computer。

graphics so specifically，in the area of geometric algorithms the，purpose of this video。

is to give you all the information that，you'll need to succeed，this semester so periodically we'll。

upload little videos，to cover administrative things to talk，about what's been going on this week。

and to answer any significant questions，that have come up，i should also say that all the。

information today is available on the，15462。courses。cs。cmu。edu。

so please go ahead check out that link，read through especially the course info。

page in detail because，there's a lot of things that i won't say，here in this video but that are。

important for you to know，as you go through the course i should，also say we have a。

great set of tas this semester so if you，have any questions，please at any time feel free to email。

them email me post a question on，piazza whatever you like to do but don't。

be shy about getting in touch，the first things you should do to get，running with a course is。

to sign up for piazza so go to，piazza。com，cmu find our course 462 and sign up。

and second to sign up for an account on，the course，webpage click on the login button in the。

upper right，and you should see a link that says sign，up to sign up。

you will need a special passcode which，is available only on，piazza so you'd better sign up for。

piazza first，before you sign up for the course web，page i should also say。

if you're not officially enrolled in，this course yet，don't worry first of all usually there's。

no trouble，getting in we don't really have much of，a class，size limitation this semester just sign。

up for the webpage，get rolling start reading through the，assignments and so forth so that if you。

do decide to add the course，you're on track so we will be running，the whole course remotely。

and it basically has three components we，have lectures we have recitations。

and we have office hours which will all，be done online，the recitations and the office hours，will be。

done through zoom and you'll be able to，find the appropriate zoom links。

on piazza the lectures will be，pre-recorded videos that you can watch。

on youtube but we will be there during，the lecture period to answer。

questions that might come up while you，watch these videos so if you're watching。

the video something doesn't make sense，just hit pause go to the zoom room。

talk to us ask us questions and then go，back to your video，a couple of tips it can be really hard i。

know when you're sitting at home to pay，attention to a long，80-minute lecture video so a couple of。

things that our students have found，are useful one is to simply speed up the。

video which you can do using youtube so，if you've never done that before you can。

give that a try right now，go to the bottom right you should see a。

little gear icon and you'll see a little，option for playback speed。

so you can speed up the video as fast as，you can as fast as you can take it。

the other thing that can be very helpful，is to just break up，watching the video into chunks so if。

it's 80 minutes long。

![](img/ea65cdb9fbc2a5384abc52696ee8b9ca_2.png)

maybe you break it up into 40 minutes，today and 40 minutes tomorrow that can，really help to。

to keep focused in terms of work that，they're really，just three main things there are many。

homeworks so this is just two or three，questions that we're going to ask。

after each lecture to just make sure，that you understand what's going on。

then there's four major coding，assignments so over the course of the，semester。

you're going to build up a 3d package，called scotty 3d，and scotty 3d is just like any modern 3d。

package it has，modeling it has rendering it has，animation but the difference is。

all of the key routines have been，stripped out and you're gonna。

go ahead and fill them in and hopefully，be able to create some really cool。

uh content really cool models and，animations and finally we will have。

a midterm and a final but please do not，sweat about this each of these is worth，only 10。

of your grade this is mainly just a，checkpoint to make sure that you，understand。

conceptually what's going on in the，course not just the，have，five late days which you can use。

completely at your discretion you don't，have to ask，us can i use it for this or that just go。

ahead and use it，in terms of collaboration we encourage，people to。

talk to their peers to have interesting，conversations on piazza to come to。

office hours and ask whatever you like，but your final work must be your own all。

assignments in this class will be，individual work all the details。

again you can find on the webpage about，collaboration and cheating and so forth。

okay that's it so if you have questions，contact，us on piazza on email whatever you like。

otherwise if you're excited about，getting rolling you can start watching，the first lecture。

right away so just go to the course，webpage you'll see our course schedule。

and you can just click on the video，links to get started。
