    of。 tricky looking regular expression that Jennifer went over in the lecture video。
    where you do this match star bar at star or text and so that will match。 everything
    in in the XML and what we do with that is we then apply that template。

    of。 data and just remove certain things and so we do that inside of a copy。 and
    inside of this copy statement we apply template， [ silence ]。 And so what we've
    done so far is we have matched and copied the entire dataset into our result。

    went over how that works in lecture。 So that just matches everything and copies
    it to the result。 And then what we need to do is match our courses with enrollment
    greater than 60 or no enrollment listed and delete them from the dataset。 And
    so this is actually the easy part where we can just do this with a simple x-path
    expression。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we'll match what we need and then just do nothing with it。 We'll just
    close it off。 And so recall we can just go to course and much， much like in one
    of the previous problems we will be accessing the enrollment field。 So we want
    enrollment greater than 60 or if no enrollment listed。 And so we do that the same
    way as we did previously where we want the count of the number of enrollments
    listed underneath this element to equal 0。

    everything and then just matched these courses with enrollment greater than 60
    or no enrollment listed which we wanted to delete。 So we just after we've copied
    everything we matched these and just do nothing with them。

    be terminated by the matching end tag。 Okay， so that looks like it's a problem

    I am returning courses that have no enrollment listed and that is my mistake up

    So I just get rid of that S and this should be good。

    here's the problem。 I'm trying to do enrollment greater than 60 and count of enrollment
    equals zero。 That should be an or。 And hopefully that makes sense why。 So we want
    enrollment greater than 60 deleted or no enrollment listed。

    correct result。 So some takeaways。 One it's just tricky to get all of the syntax
    correct in XSLT。 We had like this extra white space before the closing tag of
    copy and that causes syntax error。 So you need to not have that white space。 And
    then just something as small as having an S here misspelling something will make
    your query wrong。

    works regardless of the data set。 And then we just had this one line that was
    specific to the course catalog。 And so we can just change this to country instead
    of course。 And instead of enrollment population and instead of greater than 60，
    greater than 40，000。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And instead of count enrollment equals zero， we want count of city sub elements
    to be equal to zero。 And that should be it。 Okay， so that is incorrect。 Something
    went wrong there。 Oh right。 we wanted area greater than 40，000 not population
    greater than 40，000。 So it is perfect。
