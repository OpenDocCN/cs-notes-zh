# Lectures 16: Advanced Async

上次我们讨论了如何使用`bind`（通常写作`>>=`）和`return`原语描述并发计算。`return`函数接受一个值并返回一个立即确定的延迟计算，而`d >>= f`则等待`d`确定，然后将结果值传递给`f`，后者也计算一个延迟值。通常情况下，可能会有许多延迟计算同时执行，我们需要协调和同步它们的行为。

这些笔记基于原本在[Real World OCaml 第十八章](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/concurrent-programming-with-async.html)中开发的材料和代码示例。

  Simple Synchronization

  One simple way to coordinate deferred computations is to wait for them to become determined. The function `both` does this for the case where there are two computations:

```

val both : 'a Deferred.t -> 'b Deferred.t -> ('a * 'b) Deferred.t

```

  Recall that both can be easily implemented
using bind and return:

```

let both (d1:'a Deferred.t) (d2:'b Deferred.t) : ('a * 'b) Deferred.t =

d1 >>= (fun v1 ->

d2 >>= (fun v2 ->

return (v1,v2)))

```

  More generally, we can wait for a *list* of deferred values to
become determined using all

```

val all : ('a Deferred.t) list -> ('a list) Deferred.t

```

  One can think of all as a kind of barrier which ensures that
all of the deferred values in the list have been fully computed before
proceeding. The resulting values are available in the final list. Here
is one possible implementation of all:

```

let rec all (l:('a Deferred.t) list) : ('a list) Deferred.t =

List.fold_right

    (fun x acc ->

    x >>= (fun h ->

    acc >>= (fun t ->

    return (h::t))))

    l (return [])

```

  There is a dual to `all` called any that waits for *some* value in a list of deferreds to become determined:

```

val any : ('a Deferred.t) list -> 'a Deferred.t

```

  Note that, if several deferreds from the list 
become determined in close proximity,
the Async scheduler makes no
guarantees that the deferred computation selected will be the first that
became determined.

  Timeouts

  One application of `any` is to create functions that execute computations with a fixed time budget. The function `after` produces a deferred computation that becomes determined at a fixed time in the future:

```

val after : Core.Span.t -> unit Deferred.t

```

  The type Core.Span.t represents a span of time. The
function sec computes a span in seconds:

```

val sec : float -> Core.Span.t

```

  Hence, the expression

```

after (sec 5.3)

```

  is a deferred computation that becomes determined after approximately
5.3 seconds.
Async does not make real-time guarantees:  the 
  after will become determined after 5.3
seconds, but not necessarily *immediately* after.
  Using `after` and `any`, we can write a higher-order function that executes a deferred computation `f` until it becomes determined or reaches a timeout:

```

let timeout (thunk:unit -> 'a Deferred.t) (n:float)

: ('a option) Deferred.t

= Deferred.any

    [ after (sec n) >>| (fun () -> None) ;

    thunk () >>| (fun x -> Some x) ]

```

  The expression timeout thunk n attempts to execute the thunk
and wraps the result in the Some constructor for the option
datatype. However, if the time budget is exceeded, then the unit value
computed by after become determined and the whole computation
returns None instead. 

  The 3110 autograder uses a similar function to handle the issue of student submissions spinning off into infinite loops.

  Ivars

  Most common patterns of coordination and synchronization can be implemented using simple functions like `both`, `all`, and `any`. But in certain other situations, more intricate behavior is needed. An *ivar* can be used to implement fine-grained coordination and synchronization between deferred computations. Intuitively, an ivar is like a reference that can be assigned to, or *filled*, exactly once. Hence, an ivar is similar to a deferred computation, which is intially undetermined and then becomes determined exactly once.

  The ivars interface is captured by the following code:

```

module IVar : sig

type 'a t

val create : unit -> 'a t

val fill : 'a t -> 'a -> unit

val fill_if_empty : 'a t -> 'a -> unit

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool

val is_full : 'a t -> bool

val read : 'a t -> 'a Deferred.t

...

end =

struct

...

end

```

  Consult
the Ivar
documentation for further details.

  The key thing to notice about the `Ivar` module is the `read` function, which constructs a deferred value that becomes determined when the ivar is filled. We will use this functionality in the next example.

  The ivar abstraction was invented by John Reppy (Cornell PhD, 1992) in a language called Concurrent ML.

  Delaying Scheduler

  To illustrate the use of ivars, we will implement a simple scheduler that delays jobs by a fixed amount of time. We will need the function `upon`,

```

upon : 'a Deferred.t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

```

  which waits for a value in the first argument to become determined,
and then executes the code in the (possibly side-effecting) second
argument.

  The interface for the delaying scheduler is as follows:

```

module type DELAYER = sig

type t

val create : float -> t

val schedule : t -> (unit -> 'a Deferred.t) -> 'a Deferred.t

end

```

  The create function initializes a scheduler that delays
incoming jobs by a fixed amount of time. The schedule
function schedules a job provided by a thunk that produces a deferred
value.  The overall result of schedule is determined when the
job has been run and its value has become determined.

  The implementation for the delaying scheduler is as follows:

```

module Delayer : DELAYER = struct

type t = { delay: Core.Span.t;

            jobs: (unit -> unit) Core.Std.Queue.t }

let create n =

    { delay = Core.Time.Span.of_sec n;

    jobs = Core.Std.Queue.create () }

let schedule t thunk =

    let ivar = Ivar.create () in

    Core.Std.Queue.enqueue t.jobs (fun () ->

    upon (thunk ()) (fun x -> Ivar.fill ivar x));

    upon (after t.delay) (fun () ->

    (Core.Std.Queue.dequeue_exn t.jobs) ());

    Ivar.read ivar

end

```

  Note that the job is enqueued immediately and dequeued after the delay
has elapsed. Also note how ivar is filled and used to
communicate the final result.

  Choice

  The `any` function provides a way to choose just one of several deferred computations. However, if those computations have effects, such as opening files or socket connections, printing to the console, etc., the behavior may not be what is desired. This can lead to problems in general if these side effects are not correctly handled. However, OCaml does not provide general mechanisms to cleanly revert or shutdown a computation that has been discarded.

  To address this problem, Async provides the notion of a *choice*:

```

type Deferred.choice

```

  To construct a value of type choice, one provides a deferred
computation as well a function:

```

val choice : 'a Deferred.t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b Deferred.choice

```

  Intuitively a choice can be thought of as representing a computation
where the function is executed if the deferred computation becomes
determined and the choice is chosen. By placing all side-effecting
pieces of the computation in the function, programmers can obtain
finer-grained control if and when computations are discarded.

  The function `choose` selects a list of choices:

```

val choose : ('a Deferred.choice) list -> 'a Deferred.t

```

  Just like any, the implementation provides no guarantees
about which element will be chosen, or when it will be
determined. However, importantly it does guarantee that only one of
the functions for the choice elements is executed. This can be used to
write clean shutdown code in programs that combine deferred
computation and side
effects. See Real World OCaml Chapter 18 for a fully worked out example using choice
to build a web search client.
