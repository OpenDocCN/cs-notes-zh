The next concept we want to introduce is that of logical equivalence between two different statements。

Now the idea here is that you could have two statements and both of them could be really long， messy。

 compound statements have' got lots of or's and ans and knots and all sorts of different inputs。

 and it's not clear whether those two statements are the same thing but just presented differently。😡。

Or whether they truly are different things。And the way we're going to claim that two statements that maybe superficially do not look to be the same are in fact。

 logically equivalent。 if you have one， you get the other。

 we're going to say the logically equivalent if their truth tables are identical。

 which is to say we're saying something is logically independent or logically equivalent rather。

 if it's the case that for every pairing of their inputs。

 all true false pairings of their ps and their cues。

 that their output is going to have the exact same truth and falseness for every different possible input。

 so that is our idea is having the same truth table。😡，So here's a simple example。

 I want you to look at the statement not not P and we know that this idea of a double negative is that a double negative in English sort of cancels right if I say that I am not not hungry then that's me saying that I'm hungry that if I put a double negative in you can sort of imagine it canceling。

😡，Now。Let's just try to verify that this actually makes logical sense according to what I've told you。

 which is the truth tables。 So first of all， we're going to go in and we're going to try to fill in what's happening here for Pete。

 My two different inputs are true and false。😡，So I always do that first I put all of the possible input values that I can have my truth or falseness of that input P so then if I look at not P。

 which is just sort of an intermediate step here， if P is true then not P is going to be false。😡。

And if P is false， then not P is going to be true。 So I would just doing that as a temporary thing。

 Now， for the third column now I'm looking at not， not P。

 So I'm going to not P and taking the opposite of that。 So if， if not P is false。😡。

Then then the negation of being false is true， and so I'm going to put a true over here。

 and likewise， if my n P is true， then the negation of a true is false。

 so I'm going to put a false down here。😡，And then what I've noticed here is that these two things。

Are going to be the same thing that the the truth table for P， which is a true and a false。

 is the same thing as the truth table for not， not P again， a true or false。

 So this recovers for us the idea that。P is the same thing as not， not P。

And the way that I like to write this， I have my statement P that's my one and I'm trying to compare it to something else and I use if it's logical equivalentence。

 I use an sign， but one that's got like three horizontal lines to it that's what I mean for logical equivalents that's going my shorthand for it this is logically equivalent to not。

😡，Not peak。And it's going to turn out that there's all sorts of different logical forms that may appear to be very different。

 like not， not P superficially is written in a different way than P。

 But even though it's superficially different， they truly are the same thing。

 And our method is just write out the truth tables for both of them。

 Are they the same truth table or all they different。
