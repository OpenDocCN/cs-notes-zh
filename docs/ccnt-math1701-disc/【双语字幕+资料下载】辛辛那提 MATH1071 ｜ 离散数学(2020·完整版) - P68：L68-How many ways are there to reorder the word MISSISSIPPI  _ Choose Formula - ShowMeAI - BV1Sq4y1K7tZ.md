How many ways can I rearrange the letters of the word Mississippi？

We've seen an example like this before where I give a bunch of letters and ask。

 how many ways can you rearrange them？😡，But previously， there wasn't repetitions in the letters。

Suppose， for instance， that we had some rearrangement that had an S in the first letter。

Because we have four different Ss， it don't really care which of those four s's goes in the first location。

 I'm going to say that a rearrangement is just some particular spelling where the letters are scrambled。

 but I don't care to keep track of which S goes where I'll think that all of those are going to be the same。

😡，So here's how I can try to analyze a situation like this There are I think 11 letters in this particular work so what are we going to have one。

2，34，5，6，7， eight，9，10，11 letters that we have to fill in。😡。

Now the way I'm going to think about slotting these in is I'm first going to decide where are all the ss going to go we've got four of them。

 so let's pop the s's in first just for fun， how about I have an S I'm just going to make it up maybe there and there and there and there and that's where my one。

 two， three， four s's are going to end up。😡，And again， I don't care which order they become。

 all s's are indistinguishable， so the order in which my s's are put down doesn't matter。

 I'm just trying to figure out how many locations are there where s's could be。

So if I want to think about the number of ways I could choose where the ss were supposed to go。

 there's 11 total spots and I've chosen from the 11 spots。

 I've chosen four of them and that's where my s's are going to go and this symbol that we have this 11 choose four was our shorthand for the computation that told us how many ways could I choose four items from 11。

 in this case， four spots to put my Ss from my 11 possible spots。😡。

All right that was wonderful so now I've chose where the s's go。

 but I still to figure out where the I's go and where the P's go and where the M goes let's do I next it turns out we have one。

 two， three， four different eyess and so what I have remained is of those 11 slots for them have already been determined because I've determined the ss first。

😡，So 11 minus four leaves seven open spots。And among those seven open spots。

 I want to put in my four different eyes and again I'm just going to make up an example。

 how would I put an eye here， how would I put an eye here。

 how might I put an eye there and how would I put an eye there again。

 just making up some way but I'm slotting four eyes into these seven spots or in other words that for this step that there are seven possible spots and that there were four eyes that I could put them into and so I'm going to multiply again by seven choose four in this multiplication because these are independent events。

 how I choose my eyes does not depend on my specific choices for choosing my different ss。😡。

So this slot was for choosing my eyes， I'll just be brief and say that's for my choosing my eyes。

All right， moving right along next up， I'm going to say that I want to choose we done S and the I。

 Oh， how do we do P's， I've got two different P's here。😡，And I've got four remaining spots。

So what I'm going to do is that from those。For remaining spots I'm going to choose now there's only two ps。

 so I'm choosing two from that。And that this multiplication here is going to be representing how I put my P's in。

😡，And again， I can make up where I actually choose to put them how I put my P there and my P there doesn't really matter。

 but what's left is just a single M。 I haven't put that there and it has to come right down here。

 There's only one remaining spot for it。 Or if you want to think about it。

 there is one possible spot and there is one possible thing I want to fill it with so it's one choose one which by the way。

 you could do the arithmetic is just equal to one and so that final spot。😡，Was how I put in the M。So。

Effectively what I've done here is a multiplication of a bunch of choosing I've managed to fill this all out by multiplying four times of four different events of choosing where the yeses go。

 choosing where the eyes go， choosing where the P's go， and finally putting that last M。

So any situation that has repetitions where we don't distinguish between these repeated things is a perfect example of when we don't care about order and where we might try to use this technique of using a bunch of choose operations supposed to picking operations and here indeed that this scrambling with multiple different repeats。

 ends up being， just the multiplication of four different ways that I can choose the ss and I can choose the I's。

 choose the P's and choose the Ms and where each of those letters are going to be going among this 11 total initial spots。

😡，And then if we really wanted to， we knew that this choose notation was shorthand for a longer formula with a bunch of factorials。

 and so why don't I just come in and fill out what that's going to be？😡。

11 choose 4 was 11 factorial divided by four factorial， and then also divided by 11 minus4 factorial。

 11 minus4 is 7。 so7 factorial that was going to be the first term。Don't be confused， by the way。

 the the round brackets。 there is no line here dividing them。

 People sometimes get confused and think they're fractions。

 This notation is not meant to be a fraction。 It's just its own special notation。

 Two numbers on top of each other with a bracket。 Anyways， moving on。Then if I want to take seven。

 choose four， so this was seven factorial on the top truly divided when I use this formula divided by four factorial and seven minus four is three factorial on the bottom。

😡，And then I'm going to be multiplying by four factorial。

Divided by two factorial and two times two4 minus2 is two factorial。And one more factor here。

This is going to be one factorial， over one factorial。Divided by1 minus1， which is zero factorial。

 which is a really long and complicated way of saying who want all of this final expression is just equal to one。

 and then if we really wanted to， we could multiply out all these factorials and we could get out our final answer。
