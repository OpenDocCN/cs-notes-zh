In this videoÔºå we're going to talk about mathematical induction and mathematical induction is going to be a proof methodology„ÄÇ

 It's going to be a process by which we're going to prove a whole bunch of different claims„ÄÇ

And the analogy that we're going to use for mathematical induction is that of climbing a ladder„ÄÇ

 So how do I climb a ladderÔºü WellÔºå I claim that there are two steps to be able to climb a ladder„ÄÇ

 First stepÔºå I need to be able to actually get on the ladder„ÄÇ

 I need to be able to make it to the first rung or at least some rung of the ladder„ÄÇ

 Like if you got a fire escape up the side of a building„ÄÇ

 It might be that the first rung of the ladder is too far above youÔºå you can't get there„ÄÇ

 So that's my first step„ÄÇ I need to get on the ladder„ÄÇ Second step„ÄÇ

 I need to know that if I'm on some rung of the ladder„ÄÇ I can get to the next rung of the ladder„ÄÇ

In other wordsÔºå if I start on that first one and I can go from the first to the second then the second of the third and the third of the fourth and so on that tells me I can climb my ladder All right„ÄÇ

 so now let me contrast this with a specific mathematical claimÔºå I want to investigate this big long„ÄÇ

 messy thing„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_2.png)

It tells me that the sum of the first end numbersÔºå like one plus two plus3 up to say 10„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_4.png)

That that is going to just be equal to some formula that depends on the final number that you choose here„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_6.png)

So for instanceÔºå in the n equal to one caseÔºå you're taking the sum of only one things„ÄÇ

 the number oneÔºå and it's equal to one times one plus1Ôºå which is two divided by two„ÄÇ

 this is just a different say is equal to1 So when n is equal to oneÔºå this formula is valid„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_8.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_9.png)

And then when n is equal to2Ôºå it's one plus2Ôºå that's going to be the number three„ÄÇ

 and indeed this formula that I have over here is two times2 plus1 is6 divided by  two is3„ÄÇ

 so it checks out as well„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_11.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_12.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_13.png)

And I can look at what's going to happen in three and four and five„ÄÇ

 and I can carry on as many times as I want and the sum of say the first five things is going to obey this particular property„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_15.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_16.png)

So note what I'm provingÔºå I'm proving a sort of infinite collection of claims„ÄÇ

 and I want to do it all at the same timeÔºå as in for every positive integer N„ÄÇ

 starting that's bigger than one and going all the way upÔºå I want to have a corresponding claim„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_18.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_19.png)

So I think that this sort of style of claim I' a claim that is indexed by the positive integers„ÄÇ

 if you willÔºå it sort of resembles the latter that we're talking about„ÄÇ

 We're going say that there's this first stepÔºå a second step„ÄÇ

 a third step and going on all the way up„ÄÇ NowÔºå I have chosen for you a specific example„ÄÇ

 but we can treat this kind of situation pretty arbitrarily„ÄÇ SoÔºå for exampleÔºå instead„ÄÇ

 let me consider a property P that depends on these values n or n is going to be positive integers„ÄÇ

 So in the previous caseÔºå the property was some equality that the sum of the first n terms was equal to that formula„ÄÇ

 but this property could just be anything as long as it depends on n or is indexed by n„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_21.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_22.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_23.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_24.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_25.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_26.png)

Then what you get is this infinite family of different claimsÔºå you get a P1 claim„ÄÇ

 that might be some equality or some claim that needs to be trueÔºå you get a P2Ôºå a P3Ôºå a P4Ôºå a P5„ÄÇ

 and so on„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_28.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_29.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_30.png)

So in other wordsÔºå the general structure of these claims is again going to be a laddery first step„ÄÇ

 a third stepÔºå and so on„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_32.png)

All rightÔºå so let's think how was I going to climb my ladder Well„ÄÇ

 I had to be two different components„ÄÇ The first thing was that you can prove the first of these claims you can get on that first run„ÄÇ

 so I would like to be able to prove that P1 is true„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_34.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_35.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_36.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_37.png)

And then I want to know that if I'm on any given rungÔºå I can climb to the next one„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to come here at every step and show that if I'm on P3 I can get to P4„ÄÇ

 if I'm on P4 I get to P5Ôºå if'm P5 I can get to P6 and so on„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_39.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_40.png)

And then if I combine these two thingsÔºå because I say I can claim that I can get on the first rung and I can get from any rung to the next one„ÄÇ

 I can go from one to two and can go from two to three and go to three to four and I can climb my ladder of claims„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_42.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_43.png)

AllrightÔºå So let me make this sort of latter analogy a little bit more precise„ÄÇ

 I'm gonna to say claim that my methodology has these two different steps„ÄÇ The first step is„ÄÇ

 I want to prove that the first thing is true„ÄÇ I want to prove that P of one is going to be true„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_45.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_46.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_47.png)

And second of allÔºå I want to assume it's true at some level„ÄÇ

 I use the intermediate value K here is separate from the NMI claim is just one of the intermediate steps on my ladder„ÄÇ

 and I am assuming that it's true at the K step and I need to prove that that results in it being true at the K plus one step„ÄÇ

 so those are my two different components„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_49.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_50.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_51.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_52.png)

The first of them is typically referred to as the basis step„ÄÇ

And the second of them is going to be typically referred to as the induction step in mathematical induction„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå now notice how I started thisÔºå I said prove that P1 is true„ÄÇ

 that portion of it is a little bit arbitraryÔºå it doesn't necessarily have to be the case that you get on on that first rung maybe you get on at the10th wrong and carry on climbing so the general version of this is to replace all the ones here by just some arbitrary in a array and you say look I want to prove this for everything bigger than some a„ÄÇ

 I get on at the eighth step and then I prove this induction step for every value of k that's going to be bigger than or equal to a„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_54.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_55.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_56.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_57.png)

Often these are structured so that the A is equal to oneÔºå but this is a slightly more general setup„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_59.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_60.png)

All rightÔºå so now let's return to what we were proving before„ÄÇ

 This was going to be the claim that the sum of the first n integers„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_62.png)

Is going to have this nice formula and we've divided up into all of these steps„ÄÇ

 And so what I want to be doing is I want to be proving my basis step„ÄÇ That's the first of these„ÄÇ

 And notice I've already done that„ÄÇ I've proven this claim in the situation where p is equal to one Y the sum of one thing is equal to the one times one plus1 over2„ÄÇ

 which means n times n plus1 over two in the situation where n is equal to1„ÄÇ

 So I've proven my basis step already„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_64.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_65.png)

By the wayÔºå it's pretty common that this basis step is a super easy thingÔºå that's generally the case„ÄÇ

 not alwaysÔºå but generally the caseÔºå and the induction step is going to be the hard one„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_67.png)

So after the basic stepÔºå I have to show my induction step„ÄÇ

 I have to show how do I get from one level of this ladder to the next„ÄÇ

 so that's what we're going to look at now„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_69.png)

So we've already done the basis stepÔºå and now what we're trying to do is the induction step„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_71.png)

So the way I'm going to phrase this is first I want to assume that we have this true for PK„ÄÇ

 and what we're going to assume from our PK is we're going to try to deduce it's true for PK plus one„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_73.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_74.png)

So here is my assumption of PKÔºå I'm assuming that if I choose a specific value of k„ÄÇ

 if you think about it as running from one up to some value of nÔºå you've chosen some K in the middle„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_76.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_77.png)

So I've chosen some K and I say that some of the first K things obeys this formula„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_79.png)

Then what I want to do is I want to prove PK plus1„ÄÇAnd I'm going to start my setup like this„ÄÇ

 I'm going to begin with the sum of not the first K termsÔºå but the first K plus one terms„ÄÇüò°ÔºåNow„ÄÇ

 what can I do hereÔºüI know that the green partÔºå the sum from1 to K„ÄÇ

 that is just precisely what we've just seen above and so I can quote my formula for that„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_81.png)

So what this is equal to is I'm using my formulaÔºå I'm using my assumption„ÄÇ

 I'm using that induction assumptionÔºå and then I've got one more K plus1„ÄÇ

 which is sitting on the outside here„ÄÇOkayÔºå wellÔºå now I have this„ÄÇ

 I can do a little bit of algebra to it„ÄÇ I've got a factor of two on the bottom here„ÄÇ

 so let's put a factor of two underneath the K plus1 as well„ÄÇ

 I'm going do that little trick here So I multiply by  two and I divide by  two and then I'm going to put these together by saying look I got a K plus1 and a K plus1 those are going to come together algebraically and then I have this K and this two„ÄÇ

 They're going to come together and form a k plus2„ÄÇ So I get this little bit of algebra„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_83.png)

But this formula that I have here that's exactly what I wantÔºå this formula is this one here„ÄÇ

 but with K plus1 plugged in for n„ÄÇSo in other wordsÔºå what I got is inequality„ÄÇ

 the sum of the first K plus1 terms is that special formula for K plus1Ôºå in other words„ÄÇ

 I have shown PK plus1„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_85.png)

All rightÔºå so let's consider the logic of what I've done„ÄÇ I've taken the sum of the first end terms„ÄÇ

 and I want to show that that's going to be this formula„ÄÇAnd I broke that up into these two steps„ÄÇ

 firstÔºå the basis step where I showed it was true in the first rung of my ladder that for P1„ÄÇ

 it was true and just obviously true I goes plug in some numbers„ÄÇ

Then I assumed this general PK and to try to prove PK plus1„ÄÇ

 I took one side of my PK+1 and manipulated using my induction hypothesis to get to the other side of PK+1„ÄÇ

 and therefore I claim this claim is true for all values of n greater than one„ÄÇThis turns out„ÄÇ

 by the wayÔºå to not be the only way to prove this claim and while it's not an example of induction„ÄÇ

 I want to show you another way that we can do it at least in the case for n equal to 100 so let's suppose that I am trying to take the sum of 100 numbers„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_87.png)

By the wayÔºå there's an infamous anecdote that goes here that Gs„ÄÇ

 who's one of the most famous mathematicians of all time that in primary school when he got in trouble„ÄÇ

 his teacher told him to sum up the first hundred numbers„ÄÇ

 expecting this is going to take something a very long time to do„ÄÇ if you indeed„ÄÇ

 if you try to go1 plus2 plus3 plus it would take you a lot of time to be able to get to the answer and we'd all be very likely to make a mistake„ÄÇ

 But I'm going to show you a quick way that we can figure out what this is going to be„ÄÇ Of course„ÄÇ

 we could just apply the formula that we saw„ÄÇ But I want to show how you could come up with the formula a different way„ÄÇ

 You see there's the one here„ÄÇ And then we also have the hundred„ÄÇ

 and that those two together if I added them upÔºå that would give me a value of 101„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_89.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_90.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_91.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_92.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_93.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_94.png)

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_95.png)

But then if I move over and I take the two and I take the 99Ôºå that those two together are also 101„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_97.png)

And then the three in the 98 is 101„ÄÇ And then this sort of cycle keeps on collapsing„ÄÇ right„ÄÇ

 I can go always take these pairs„ÄÇ They're always gonna add up to 101 At some point„ÄÇ

 I'm gonna get to the middle when I'm going have my 50 and my 51„ÄÇ

 that's gonna give me another value of 101„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_99.png)

So if I think about what happens here is I've got when I take this sum„ÄÇ

 I've got a whole bunch of 101s„ÄÇ

![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_101.png)

And in factÔºå there's one all the way up to 50 of them because then the 51 up 100 are already sort of paired away„ÄÇ

 so what I have is 50 copies of 101 or in other wordsÔºå 5050„ÄÇ



![](img/cb92710416d5dce19bd749caf66ea55f_103.png)

Another way to say it is that if I want to use my summation notation for this„ÄÇ

 I could describe this as the sum from one up to100 of„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

My ak is just the value of k right So when k is equal to1 it's1Ôºå K is 2 is 2„ÄÇ K is3 is 3„ÄÇ

 That's exactly what I want„ÄÇ1 plus2 plus 3„ÄÇ So this is some summation„ÄÇ

And what we had just argued is that that was going to be 50 copies of 101„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to write it is 50 times 101Ôºå which I can manipulate„ÄÇ

 I could multiply top and bottom by twoÔºå got 100 over2 times 101„ÄÇ

 which is exactly what the formula gave„ÄÇ
