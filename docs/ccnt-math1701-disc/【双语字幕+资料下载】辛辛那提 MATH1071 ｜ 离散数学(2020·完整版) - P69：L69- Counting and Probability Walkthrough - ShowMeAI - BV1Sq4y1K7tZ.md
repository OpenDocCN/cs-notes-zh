AlrightÔºå so first upÔºå I'm looking at this„ÄÇ5Ôºå choose2„ÄÇ And this is just a formula„ÄÇ

 want to see whether you memorize the formula whether you haven't„ÄÇ

 So the formula we know is that it's going to be 5 factorial divided by two factorial„ÄÇ

 divided by 5-2 factorial„ÄÇ So that's the formula„ÄÇN factorial over R factorial over n minus r factorial„ÄÇ

And then if I multiply this outÔºå this is going to be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 on the top on the bottom„ÄÇ

Two times 1Ôºå and then three times  two times 1„ÄÇSo all of this portion cancelsÔºå the3Ôºå2Ôºå1 cancels„ÄÇ

 the two and the four cancels leads with a twoÔºå and that looks I like a five times two sort just get a 10„ÄÇ

 All rightÔºå lovely„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå next upÔºå how many ways to reorder the letters in the word CincinnatiÔºå this is a review„ÄÇ

 we've seen this kind of problem a couple times„ÄÇAnd the idea here is I figured out how many ways can I slot in one of the letters„ÄÇ

 How many different ways can I slot in the next letter and so on on the line„ÄÇ So let's do C first„ÄÇ

 I know that there's two different Cs„ÄÇ And I'm also going to count that there's 1Ôºå2Ôºå3Ôºå4Ôºå5Ôºå6Ôºå7Ôºå8Ôºå9„ÄÇ

10 different letters here„ÄÇ So there's 10 possible spots„ÄÇ

So the way I'm going to think about this is that first I can figure out where is it the Cs are going to go„ÄÇ

 there's 1 possible spotsÔºå there's two CsÔºå and now I filled up two of the spots somewhere in this long list„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that's good„ÄÇ Next upÔºå I'm going to fill out the eyes and I say that there's  oneÔºå2„ÄÇ

 three different eyes in Cincinnati„ÄÇBut I've used up two of my 10 spots„ÄÇ There's only 8 spots left„ÄÇ

 and I got to footÔºå fit three eyes in those8 spots„ÄÇ So I'm gonna have my8 spots remaining„ÄÇ

I can put my three eyes in and there it goes like that„ÄÇOkayÔºå next up N 1Ôºå2Ôºå3 different ends„ÄÇ

 So I've already used up„ÄÇ5 spots totalÔºå the two Cs and the three eyes„ÄÇ So got five spots remaining„ÄÇ

 And then I have 1Ôºå2Ôºå3 ends remaining„ÄÇ So 5Ôºå choose 3„ÄÇ

And then I believe there's only an A and there's only a T left„ÄÇ so there's two spots„ÄÇ

 and I had to choose one of them for the A„ÄÇAnd you can write this last one down or not„ÄÇ

 whatever you likeÔºå there's one spot left for the TÔºå and there's only one spot to put in there„ÄÇ

 So it's oneÔºå choose oneÔºå which is just oneÔºå who you want to think about this„ÄÇ

So I did this where I was choosing the C's firstÔºå where I was choosing the I'sÔºå first„ÄÇ

 where I was choosing the NsÔºå then the A'sÔºå and finally the T's„ÄÇ

 but if you wanted to do it in a different orderÔºå it might look a little bit different here„ÄÇ

 but it be the same thing„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_4.png)

All rightÔºå wonderful„ÄÇSo next upÔºå a coin is tossed 10 times and the results going to be recorded„ÄÇ

 So how many total possible outcomes are there going to be„ÄÇWellÔºå in this case„ÄÇ

 there's two possibilities for every flip„ÄÇ It's either heads or its tails„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to say that there's  two„ÄÇ And then since there's 10 total flipsÔºå it's two times2 times„ÄÇ

2 times2 times 2 all the way down in all the slots„ÄÇ So I think two to the power of 10„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_6.png)

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_7.png)

Al right„ÄÇ How many of those outcomes have exactly five heads now„ÄÇ

What I want you to notice is that this is sort of a binary thing„ÄÇ It's either heads or its tails„ÄÇ So„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå if I know the locations of all the heads„ÄÇ

Then that immediately tells me the locations of all the tails because it's either heads or tails„ÄÇ

So how many outcomes have exactly five heads„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 I got to think about how can I choose which of those 10 flips are going to have heads„ÄÇ

 And I because there's five of themÔºå I want to choose five possible spots where they're going to be heads„ÄÇ

 and the remaining five spots are all going to be tails„ÄÇSo in other words„ÄÇ

 what I'm saying is that's there's 10 total flipsÔºå five of them are heads„ÄÇ

 and I get to choose which of those flips have the five headsÔºå so it's 10Ôºå choose five„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_9.png)

AllrightÔºå How many outcomes have at least seven heads„ÄÇSo notice here there's a couple possibilities„ÄÇ

 There's 7 headsÔºå8 headsÔºå9 heads and 10 heads„ÄÇ So it's a sum of four different things„ÄÇ

 It's the sum of how many ways can you from 10 possible flips„ÄÇ Can you choose 7„ÄÇ

 But then I got to addÔºå I got to add„ÄÇ10 choose 8Ôºå cause that's how many have 8 flips„ÄÇ10Ôºå choose 9„ÄÇ

 That's how many have 9 flips„ÄÇ And finallyÔºå10„ÄÇ chooseose 10Ôºå whichÔºå by the wayÔºå just one„ÄÇ

 That would be the one cop case where every single one of them heads„ÄÇ

So one now I look at the keyword of at least the at least tells me it 7Ôºå8Ôºå9 or 10„ÄÇ

 and then so I have to do one computation for each of those and add it up„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_11.png)

AlrightÔºå so now if I want to look at how many outcomes have at most two heads„ÄÇ

 this is sort of similar„ÄÇ The the at most is similar to the at leastÔºå but it works on the other side„ÄÇ

 If it's at most two headsÔºå it could be there's 0 heads„ÄÇ

 It be there's one head or could be there's two heads„ÄÇ So I'm going to say10Ôºå choose 0„ÄÇ

 that's the one way that they're all tails„ÄÇI could then add the the 10 different ways„ÄÇ

10 choose 1 will be 10„ÄÇ The 10 different ways I could have only one head„ÄÇ

 and then I add the 10 choose two different ways that there could be two heads„ÄÇ

So pay a lot of attention to whether you say it's exactly in which case it's only the one„ÄÇ

 at least in case it's the one or higher or at most or which case it's the one or lower„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_13.png)

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_14.png)

All rightÔºå maybe we not„ÄÇOkayÔºå so an instructor gives an exam and it's got 14 questions total„ÄÇ

Students are choosing some subset of 10 to answer„ÄÇI did a few of these types of exams back in the day„ÄÇ

 I wasn't real a fan of themÔºå but at least they're a rich example for our probability„ÄÇ

So how many different choices of 10 questions are there„ÄÇ So you got these 14 questions„ÄÇ

 Students choose which of the 10 they want to have count for mark„ÄÇ

 So I think it's going to be the 10„ÄÇOhÔºå excuse me„ÄÇI want to have„ÄÇThe 14 possibilities„ÄÇ

 they are choosing 10 from that„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_16.png)

So lot of these questions are the same kind of like choose notation„ÄÇ

 but they might be said in different ways„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_18.png)

Next upÔºå How many groups of 10 questions containÔºå OhÔºå I got to read before„ÄÇ

 Suppose six questions require proof„ÄÇAnd eight questions do not require proof All right„ÄÇ

 so how many groups of 10 questions contain four that require proof and six that do not„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

So I think the idea is that first of all I'm going to choose which of my four require proof„ÄÇ

 I'll do that firstÔºå and then independently from that„ÄÇ

 I'm going to choose which of my six do not require proof„ÄÇüò°ÔºåSo first of all„ÄÇ

 there's six questions that require proof„ÄÇ I have to choose four of them„ÄÇ So I have to take the six„ÄÇ

 and I'm choosing four of them„ÄÇAnd I'm going to be careful„ÄÇ I'm adding or multipied„ÄÇ

The way we're doing this this is kind of like the rearranges of Cincinnati„ÄÇ

 it's an independent eventÔºå so I have the one event choosing the proof questions and then I multiply that by the next event which is choosing the non proof questions„ÄÇ

So then I have to choose six questions without proofs among the eight that don't have proofs„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to choose eight choose sucks„ÄÇSo it's a product of these two things„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so now I have this questionÔºå how many groups of 10 questions contain at least one„ÄÇ

 there's that at least one again that require proof„ÄÇ

But we have eight without proofs and six with proofs„ÄÇ So every single possible test„ÄÇ

 even if the students use eight of them without proofs„ÄÇ

 they're still going to have to do two with proofs„ÄÇ

 So how many groups contain at least one that require proof this is going to be all of them„ÄÇ

Every single possibilityÔºå so it's that original the 14 choose 10„ÄÇ

 no matter what it is that they chooseÔºå it's always going to have at least one that's going to do proofs okay„ÄÇ

 fair enough„ÄÇNowÔºå the next oneÔºå thoughÔºå is„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_20.png)

That contains at most three„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_22.png)

If we think about the possibilities„ÄÇThe worst case scenario is8Ôºå with no proof„ÄÇ

And then two with proof„ÄÇ That's a possibility„ÄÇ You'd also have seven with no proof and three with the proof„ÄÇ

And that would be the case they at most„ÄÇ and then there's there's more like four proofs but we're not considering that„ÄÇ

 So I think there's really just two casesÔºå three proofs„ÄÇAnd two proofs„ÄÇSo the one„ÄÇ

 which is two proofs„ÄÇ we're gonna have a sum of two things„ÄÇ

 the sum of two proofs and the sum of three proofs„ÄÇ The one that's the two proofs well„ÄÇ

Of the six proof questions I choose to„ÄÇAnd then I've used up two problems„ÄÇ

 And then so of my eight questions that are not proof„ÄÇ I have to use all eight of them„ÄÇ

 So eight years they kind of boringre„ÄÇAnd the next one is of my sixÔºå I choose three proof ones„ÄÇ

And of my8 non proofÔºå I have to choose 7 and both the  two plus 8 or the 3 plus7 as up to the 10„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_24.png)

All rightÔºå wonderful„ÄÇMoving right along„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_26.png)

So suppose now the exam instruction specified that at most one of questions one and two may be included among the 10 or different scenario„ÄÇ

 nothing to do with proofs or non proofsÔºå we're saying at most one of the questions one and two may be included among the 10„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåTwo possibilitiesÔºå zero of the first two includedÔºå and then we got the remaining 10„ÄÇ

Or one of the first two is includedÔºå and then we've got the remaining nine„ÄÇ

So let's do the first one firstÔºå I'm going to have zero included of the first two„ÄÇ

And then of the 12 remainingÔºå there's 10 spots open„ÄÇ

 and so that's what it is 12 times 10 where I've taken0 of the first twoÔºå if you want to„ÄÇ

 you can come in here and say of the twoÔºå you choose 0Ôºå2Ôºå chooseÔºå0„ÄÇ

 you could multiply it out because the zero factorial„ÄÇ

 is's just going to be equal to the value of one„ÄÇEith wayÔºå that's the number of zeros„ÄÇ

0 questions from the first two„ÄÇ And now from the one of the first twoÔºå will you choose the one„ÄÇ

Two possibilities„ÄÇ You choose one for it„ÄÇAnd then you now have also 12 remaining things you can choose„ÄÇ

But you've used up one„ÄÇ So there's only 9 remaining„ÄÇOkayÔºå and final one„ÄÇ

 suppose the exam question specified that either both questions one and two are included or neither is to be included kind a kind of a funny one„ÄÇ

 so two cases„ÄÇTheThe first case is when none of them are included„ÄÇ

 The second case is when both of them included„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so none of them included„ÄÇ

We've done that before„ÄÇ That's going to be the two times 0„ÄÇAnd then times of the 12„ÄÇ

 you have to choose 10„ÄÇ's that's the one case„ÄÇ And in the next case is of the two„ÄÇ

 you choose both of themÔºå two times2Ôºå choose2„ÄÇAnd then of the 12 remainingÔºå you only have 8 left„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_28.png)

To choose„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_30.png)

WowÔºå pokerÔºå wonderful„ÄÇSo considering standard deck of cardsÔºå 13 dominations„ÄÇ

 four suits per denominationÔºå a hand of five cards does not care about the order Okay so that's good„ÄÇ

 this is something we had to we had to sort of sidestep around in the past„ÄÇ

 we don't care about order here so does it matter if you've got for exampleÔºå a pair„ÄÇ

 doesn't matter where they come in the first two slots in the last two or the middle„ÄÇ

 doesn't matter where they come„ÄÇSo use the choose formula to compute the total number of5 card hands„ÄÇ

We have 52 spotsÔºå52 cards to choose from„ÄÇ And what we're doing is we're choosing 5„ÄÇ So it's just 52„ÄÇ

 chooseose 5„ÄÇ13 pin 4 is 52„ÄÇ So 52 choose 5„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_32.png)

OkayÔºå soÔºå so now we've got this this question where we're trying to figure out what a full house is„ÄÇ

Full house is three things of the same denomination and then two things that are repeated of a different domination„ÄÇ

 so like 888 A six„ÄÇOr A8 A88Ôºå it wouldn't matter three of the same denomination and then two of the same denomination„ÄÇ

So I'm going to figure out how can I do this and my strategy is going to be this„ÄÇ

 I'm going to pick these denominations first and after I pick the denominations„ÄÇ

 I'm going to pick the suits for the denominations„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_34.png)

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_35.png)

So first of allÔºå I have 52 or excuse meÔºå 13 possible denominations„ÄÇ

I want to choose one for the triple„ÄÇ So I'm going to do 13Ôºå choose1„ÄÇ

 and that's going to be choosing the triple„ÄÇSo I'll writeÔºå choose the the triple„ÄÇ

 the denomination of the triple„ÄÇAnd then I want to choose the denomination of the double„ÄÇ

 So now there's 12 denominations left because the double in the triple can't be the same and I have to choose one of those„ÄÇ

So this is gonna to be choose the double„ÄÇAnd maybe I all write denominator or denomination on the bottom„ÄÇ

DeenominationÔºå because I'll do the suits the next„ÄÇ And then now that I've chosen those„ÄÇ

 I have to figure out what suits are going to be so„ÄÇI look at the triple„ÄÇ

 well there's four possible suitsÔºå but I have to choose three of themÔºå so four choose three„ÄÇ

And then for the doubleÔºå I have four suitsÔºå but I'm only choosing two cards„ÄÇ

 so I have to choose two of those„ÄÇSo this is going to be the triple suit„ÄÇ

And the final ones going to be the double suit„ÄÇSo the suit is the triple and the suit of the double„ÄÇ

 So it's just again a big product of these„ÄÇ You choose the denominations„ÄÇ

 You choose the suits for the denominations„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_37.png)

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_38.png)

All rightÔºå so„ÄÇMexed upÔºå we have OhÔºå three of a kind„ÄÇ wonderful„ÄÇ So againÔºå we have the threeÔºå8„ÄÇüòäÔºåBut„ÄÇ

 but now we have that theÔºå the next cards could be just anything at all„ÄÇ It doesn't really matter„ÄÇ

 So same story for the8s„ÄÇ I've got 13 denominations for those„ÄÇ

 I'm going to choose one of them to be the denominations of the triple„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_40.png)

All rightÔºå next upÔºå I have to deal with these these two extras„ÄÇ

 so I've got 12 possible denominations for them„ÄÇAnd I have two cards that I want to choose„ÄÇ

 And notice that like I got be careful here„ÄÇ I don't want to do 12Ôºå chooseose 1„ÄÇ

 and then 11 choose oneÔºå because that would be where order would matter or matter which of these I picked first„ÄÇ

 This is not the case„ÄÇ So do 12Ôºå choose2„ÄÇThen I got to figure out the suits so I got to figure out the suit for the three of the kind„ÄÇ

 so again there's four possibilities for the suits and I choose three„ÄÇ

Now I got to choose the possible suits for the first of these flip ones„ÄÇ

 so I've got four different suits I choose one of them and for the second of these extras„ÄÇ

 four possible suitsÔºå choose one of them„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_42.png)

So what have we got„ÄÇWe are making a„ÄÇ we got a company„ÄÇ We got passwords„ÄÇ

 They must be 35 symbols long„ÄÇ That can't be right„ÄÇ I think I meanÔºå3Ôºå2„ÄÇ

5 symbols log and composed of the 26 letters of the alphabet„ÄÇ

How many passwords are possible if repetition is allowed„ÄÇ

So in this question where I've got three to fiveÔºå the key sort of distinguishing characteristic is that„ÄÇ

I want to be able to add the number of cases where there's  three and then then cases where there's  four and the cases where there's  five„ÄÇ

So what I'm going to say is that if repetition is allowedÔºå then the 26 can go in every slot„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going to say is it's 26 cubeÔºå that's the number of ways that there's there's three password long ones„ÄÇ

 three little long passwords„ÄÇAnd then it's 26 to the fourÔºå that's the number of ways where you have„ÄÇ

4 symbol long passwords and finally 26 to the power of five„ÄÇSo that's with repetition here„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_44.png)

And then how many passwords contain no repeated symbols„ÄÇ So same storeÔºå let's do 3Ôºå4Ôºå and 5„ÄÇ

 and we'll add them up together„ÄÇ But if it's repeatsÔºå thoughÔºå weÔºå we have to knock one out„ÄÇ

 So it's like 26 for the first spotÔºå25 for the third for the next spot„ÄÇ And then and then 24„ÄÇ

 So that's the one of the three„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_46.png)

One of four are 26Ôºå25Ôºå24Ôºå23„ÄÇ So we're using up one every time and then for  fives„ÄÇ26Ôºå25„ÄÇ24„ÄÇ

23 and finally 22„ÄÇ And yesÔºå it's perfectly valid to just write it out like this where you don't want to try to multiply with that number is just leave it as a big expression„ÄÇ



![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_48.png)

And then how many passwords have at least one repeated symbolÔºå so that's interesting„ÄÇ

I want to do it the other way around because because it's all these ones„ÄÇ

 like at least one repeated somebody have to be likeÔºå wellÔºå one repeatedÔºå two repeated„ÄÇ

 three repeated four and so on„ÄÇSo what I want to do is all the passwords„ÄÇ

Minus those that have no repeats at allÔºå and what you're going to be left with is the thumb that have at least one repeat„ÄÇ

So the total number of passwords was going to be the 26 cubed„ÄÇ

The 26 to the fourth and the 26th to the fifthÔºå so that's the total number of passwords„ÄÇ

And then from thisÔºå we're going to subtract off what we previously done„ÄÇ

 So we've previously done was how many have no repeats„ÄÇ So you know whatÔºå I don't want to repeat it„ÄÇ

 I'm a good idea„ÄÇ Don't want to repeat the number of repeats„ÄÇ

 I'm going to take this whole thing here„ÄÇ and I'm going to fire it right back down there„ÄÇ

 And I've got the total minus the no repeats„ÄÇ And that's gonna to leave me with the sum number of repeats„ÄÇ

 which is exactly what this question asked for„ÄÇ

![](img/901b793250d543aa0cfc8f56ae900986_52.png)

And then we're done„ÄÇ
