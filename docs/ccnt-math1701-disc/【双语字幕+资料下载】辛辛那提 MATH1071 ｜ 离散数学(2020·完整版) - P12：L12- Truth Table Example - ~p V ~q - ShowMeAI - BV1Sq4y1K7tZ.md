So to give you a little bit of a flavor for how these things can get a little bit more complicated。

 look at this statement here。So we're going to have notch P or not Q and I want to try to figure out what does this mean is' already getting a little bit complicated and of course I could keep on adding I could add an R。

 I could add more variables and keep on combining these negations and conjunctions and or's as much as I wish。

So I would have had the systematic way of doing it and we're going to use the truth table here。

 so let's pull up our template and you're going to notice that it's going to be a little bit bigger than it was last time。

So if I go way off to the left， again， we're going to have the same sort of beginning parts here。

 so I want to have an initial input variable P。And another initial input Q。

 so those are my same two inputs that we've had before and I can go down and fill out the different possibilities that we have exactly if we've done before。

 I could have true and true， I could have true and false， I could have false and true。

 and I could have false。And false， so the same sort of beginning moves here。 Now。

 I don't want to jump right to the final con here， and I want to jump right to this final answer。

I want to give some intermediate ones that are going help me a lot。

 So what I'm going to do in these ones is I'm going to put knock P here。

 and I'm going to put knockq over there， and I'm going to try to figure out what those are。

 And then finally after I'm done with everything I can come down here and I can come and put this inside of there。

Allright， so not p is just exactly the opposite of whatever p is if p is going to be true。

 then not p is going to be false P is true not p is false P is false， not p is true and P is false。

 not p is true All right so I'm able to fill that in pretty easily sing with notq。

 not Q I just look at Q and then I take the negation of very1 so ifq is true。

 then notq is going to be false。False is going to turn into a true。

 true is going to turn into a false and false is going to turn into a true。

So now comes the tricky part， I want to put these two things together because I have that it's going to be not P or not Q and so that tells me if one of the two of these columns。

 but not p and the not Q columns is true then my output is going to be true as well。

 so what I have here I have a false and a false so neither of them is true it's not the case that one or the other one is going to be so neither of them is true and so therefore it is going to be false。

Down here， one of the two is true， this one's true， so one or the other is true， yep， that works。

 that's going to be a true。True and false one or the other， that's going to be another true。

 and true and true， one of them going to be true， in fact， both of them are true。

 and so that's going to be a final true。So what do I get false， true， true， and true？

So these truth tables are very useful at taking these complicated， compounded。

 logical statements and just trying to interpret when are they false and when are they true。

 depending on the initial parametersmmar， the pees， and cus。
