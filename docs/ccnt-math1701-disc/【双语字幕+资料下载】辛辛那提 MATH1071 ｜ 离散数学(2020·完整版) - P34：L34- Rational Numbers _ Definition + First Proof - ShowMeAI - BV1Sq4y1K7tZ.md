In this video， we're going to talk about the rational numbers。

 We're going to define the rational numbers and we're going to prove a simple direct theorem about the rational numbers。

 So what even our rational numbers， my informal definition is that a rational number is a fraction of different integer。

 something like 3 divided by 7 or two divided by 4 or 100 divided by one。

 anything like that where you've got an integer on the top and a nonzero integer on the bottom。 Now。

 well， speaking about rationals being fractions is perfectly fine globally。

 we actually want to use a theorem where we need to use very precise statement。

 So I'm going to use universal quantifier to say exactly what I mean by a fraction。 in particular。

 if I have a number n and n is going to be a fraction。

 then what I'm saying is that there is actually two other integers。 there's a P， which is an integer。

 and there's a Q， which is a nonzero integer， and it has the particular property that N can be written as。

Quotient， this P divided out by Q。 you need to have the Q be non zero。

 Otherwise you have a division by zero problem。 But in essence。

 what this particular definition is doing is it's making an existential claim twice。

 There is this P and there is this Q where the p's in the integers and the Q is in the nonzero integers。

 By the way I have a bit of funny notation here， when I write the Z。

 and then the slash and then the set brackets and then the0。

 What I mean by that weird notation is that this is the nonze integers。 or in other words。

 all of the integers minus， that's what the slash means， minus the set that only contains 0。

 So the nonze integers。Okay， so now let's go and make a formal proof about this。

 The proof I'm going to prove today is that the sum of two rational numbers。

 the sum of two fractions is another fraction。Okay， so how do we do this Now。

 in my previous video where I was talking about evens and odds。

 we saw how to do a direct proof and a direct proof。 you always began with the assumption。

 and you went until you got to the conclusion。 So I'm going to do that， too。

 Im going write down is my first line of my proof before I even know how to do this。

 I'm going to write down what my assumption is。 So what is my assumption。

 I'm saying the sum of two rationals。 is rational。 So in other words。

 I'm saying I have two rationals。 My assumption is I have two rationals。 So for my assumption。

 I write that down， and the only thing I do differently here as I give them names。 M and N。

 those are my two different rationals。😊，Now， I'm going to apply the formal definition of M and N being rational。

 The definition that we put up on the previous slide。 Well， what does it say for M being rational。

 it tells me that there's two integers， P and Q acused non0 that it can be written as the quotient。

 And like my friend， there's another P as's an integer。

 There's another Q as a non0 integer so that it can be written as this quotient， Or in other words。

 to summarize it， it can be written like this， where I have this P1 and Q1 and a P2 and a Q2。Note。

 by the way， that because they're different numbers。

 you want to keep track of the different P's and different Qs。 That's why I use these subscripts。

 The P1 and the Q1 goes with the M， the P2 and the Q2 goes with the M。😡，Okay。

 so I go to my assumption and my definition of my assumption。

 the step3 that I want to look at is what I usually call manipulations。

 manipulations are if you've got your definitions of your assumptions。

 how can you match them together， use other things you know and manage to get to the conclusion。😡。

Well， to figure out what kind of manipulation I should do。 let me take a look at the conclusion。

 Well， the conclusion says the sum of two rationals is rational。

 So I want to investigate the sum of M plus N。 This gives me a starting spot。 So let me go do that。

 Let me go and put up what the sum of M plus n is。 Well。

 it's the one fraction plus the other fraction。😊，Now， where am I going， My goal is that this sum。

 this M plus N is， in fact， a quotient。 That's what I want to have。 That it's a quotient。Okay。

 so if this is a quotient， how can I make P1 over Q1 plus P2 over Q2 look like just a quotient of one thing on the top。

1 thing on the bottom。 Well， I have an algebra trick for that。 It is lowest common denominator。

So I'm going to take the P1 over the Q1， and I'm going to multiply that by Q2 on the top and Q2 on the bottom。

😡，I'm going to take the P2 over the Q2， I'm going to multiply that by Q1 on the top and Q1 on the bottom。

😡，In doing this way， multiplying the left by Q2 S and the right by Q1s lets me get the lowest common denominator of Q1 times Q2 on the bottom。

 So putting this together as the lowest common denominator， this is what I'm going to get。 this P1。

 Q2 plus P2， Q1 all divided by Q1， Q2。Now， why did I do that， I。

 I wanted to have it looking like a fraction。 And now it kind of does。 There's a top。

 There's a bottom。So if I really want to conclude that M plus n is going to be a rational。

 I needed a top in the bottom。 And there they are。 So let's define a P3 and a Q3。

 My final top and my final bottom where P3， the top is going to be the top of this。

 And Q3 is going to be the bottom。 So what do I get P3 is the P1， Q2 plus P2， Q1。And Q3 is the Q1 Q2。

All right。 I'm doing good。 That's my manipulation。 Am I ready to say the definition of my conclusion yet。

 I think so with one little twist is to note that the P3 is the product in sum of integers。

 So it's an integer as it needed to be。 The Q3 is a product of non0 integers。

 And so it is also a non0 integer。😊，And so I can come along here and claim that I have a P3。

 and I have a Q3 where the P3 is an integer and the Q3 is a non0 integer。

 and my sum can be rendered as that quotient。😡，Well， I'm doing pretty good right now。

 Fi line is to say the actual conclusion。 This was the definition of the conclusion。

 So now let's write it as an English sentence。 It's that my M plus M is rational。

 and I can put my little QE D box at the very end of it because I have finally proven my proof。

So this particular structure， assumption， definition of assumption， manipulation。

 definition of conclusion， and finally conclusion， that five step process for direct proofs。

 it served us well for even a nod and now it's serving us well once again when we're talking about rational numbers。

😡。
