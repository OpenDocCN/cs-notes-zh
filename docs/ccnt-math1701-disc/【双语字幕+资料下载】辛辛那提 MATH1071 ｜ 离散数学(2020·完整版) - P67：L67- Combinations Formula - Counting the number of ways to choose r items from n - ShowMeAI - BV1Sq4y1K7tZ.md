In our various explorations of counting and probability so far。

 we've typically cared about the order in which we pick different choices， so for example。

 we might talk about passwords where we care what is the first digit， what is the second digit。

 what is the third digit， and so on。😡，But in a whole bunch of different applications where we're wanting to do counting。

 where we're wanting to do probability as well， we don't care about the order in which things come out。

 So let me take as an example。 I'm trying to assemble a team of people。

 I'm trying to assemble a group of three people who are going to work on some team。

 and I've got this larger possible five people that I could choose the three people from。

 I don't care who I choose first。 I don't care who I choose second。

 The order in which I choose them doesn't matter。😡。

And so the key word that's in this particular expression here is going to be this word choose。

 and whenever you see the word choose， you should be thinking， I don't care which way they come out。

😡，This is in contrast to the word pick that we've seen before。

 If I say how many ways can I pick three people from five people where I'm caring who comes first。

 and I care who comes second， then that's one where order matters。

 When I just say I want to choose them doesn't matter who my team's going to be。Now。

 if this problem was one where we did care about order。

 then we could have done it by the methods that we've seen before。

 we would say something like this that for the first person that there's five possibilities that for the second person。

 one's already used up so that there's four possibilities and that for the third one where you've used up two。

 there's only three possibilities。😡，And then we had seen that this particular expression five times four times three was going to be the same thing as if I picked and we used a p it and note it。

From five items， a total of three items and that this had the broader formula。

 the larger number factorial divided by5 minus R。 so in this case5 minus3 factorial and that those were all going to be the same so that's how I would have solved the old problem if I did care about order。

😡，So my strategy now for this problem， if I return back to the original one。😡。

I I'm going to take the number of ways that I could count this when I do care about the order。

 and I'm going to divide it by the number of ways I can order it。😡，In other words。

 I'm going to try and figure out what P53 is we've looked at that。

 but I am going to then divide it out by whatever the number of ways。That I can order this。All right。

 well， if I've got three people in a team， then how many ways are there to reorder them。

 that's a problem we've actually looked at in the past。

There's three possibilities who I could put first， and then there's two possibilities for who I could put second。

 and then there's only one possibility for who I could put third。😡，So in other words， this p53。

 which we had computed before， five times four times three on the top， five。Times four。

 times three on the top， it divides out by the number of ways that I could reorder those three things。

 three for the first option， two for the second option， and one for the third。In other words。

 what we have here is。Pick。5ive comma 3， the number of ways I can pick three things from five thingss divided out by three factorial。

So for example， if I had chosen Chris， Christine and Cory。

 then those were gonna be the three people on my team。

 then what I'm doing when I divided up by the three factorial is saying the choice where I go Chris。

 Christine， Cory in the choice where I go Chris， Cory， Christine where I go Christine， Chris。

 Cory and all the different ways that I could add those up and permute that order that all of those are the same it's the same three people on my team eventually and so I'm just dividing out by the different number of ways that I could reorder them。

😡，So I think of this as picking is something where order matters so I can do that computation first that we've seen before。

 and then I don't care about order， so I divide up by the number of ways to reorder it。😡。

More generally， I can take the lesson of this example。

And I can give a notation that is typically done like this。 It is usually written N on the top。

 and then R on the bottom。 And you put brackets around this。 So。

 so this notation is is sometimes going to also be rewritten as choose。

N comma R to be sort of compatible with our pick N comma R notation we've seen before but the most common way to say how to choose R things from n things is this notation with these brackets。

 you put them on top of each other。😡，And effectively。

 what it is going to be defined as is the way that I pick from end things are things。😡。

Dividide it out by the number of ways that I can rearrange and so are factorial on the bottom。😡。

And then since I have a formula for this picking formula， we know that that was going to be。

 I'll leave the one over R factorial on the bottom of the front。

 and I'll just deal with the pick portion。 This was an n factorial on the top。

Divided by n minus R factorial。Or perhaps if I want to clean it up a little bit。

 n factorial on the top， divided by r factorial on the bottom。

 while applied by n minus r factorial also on the bottom。😡，And so this formula that I've got in here。

This is how I choose。Our objects， R is the smaller one， our objects。From a total of n。Without。😡。

Carrying about my order。
