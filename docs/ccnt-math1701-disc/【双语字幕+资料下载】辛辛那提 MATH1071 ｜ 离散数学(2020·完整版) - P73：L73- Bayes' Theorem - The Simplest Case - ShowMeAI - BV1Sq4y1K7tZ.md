In this video， we're going to see an incredibly powerful theorem in the context of probability called Bayes theorem and Bayes theorem provides the basis for something called Bayesian inference and ist a really enormous deal that really changed how we think about probabilities and a lot of statistics in general。

 Now， I'm going to in this video， just illustrate the very simplest example。 And in the next video。

 we're going to jump it up to the sort of next level of difficulty。

 So the first thing I want to introduce is what actually is the theorem。 Now。

 we have seen conditional probability already。 So I' am going to remind you that previously。

 we've seen the following fact。😊，That is， we've seen that the probability of a given B was the probability that A and B occurred。

 the intersection divided it out by the probability of B。

Now I'm going to rearrange this I'm going to go the other way around， so if I have this。

 I can also therefore look at what happens if I take the probability of B given A， so the same thing。

 but just flip the other way around and。😡，By comparing these two。

 it just has to be the probability now it's B intersect A。😡。

Note that that doesn't matter A intersect B and B intersect A。

 I can flip those around it doesn't make any difference。

And then now it's all divided out by the probability of a。

So we have these two different components and you'll notice that there's this portion。

 the numerator that these two things are indeed going to be equal so I can take the one。

 the bottom one， and I can substitute it into the top one。

 So what that's going to give me is that the probability of a given B is equal to well。

 the probability of the intersection， but I'm going to rewrite that is the probability of B given A。

😡，Multiped by the probability of a。😡，And then all divided out by the probability of B。

 as I have down in the bottom right here。😡，So what I want you to note about this formula。

 this is going to be Bays theorem right here， this is what it is at least in the single case where we've only got1 B that we're interested in and what we have here is that we can sort of alternate the A given B or B given A we can change that rule around by multiplying by this particular ratio。

 the probability of a divided by the probability of B Now the reason why this is so helpful is that sometimes computing the probability of a given B is easy and sometimes the probability of B given a is easy sometimes they're both easy but in any scenario where one of those two is easy to compute。

 maybe you can go out of the real world and collect some data and figure it out but that the other of the two is a little bit more challenging you can use this formula that convert them you can get from the one conditional probability to the other conditional probability they're related by Bay theorem。

So let's look at an example we've seen before in the previous video。

 but we're going to investigate it in the context of this base theorem。

So the example was if you have a couple and they've got two different children and you're asserted that at least one of those children is going to be a girl。

 then what's the probability that both of the children are going to be a girl so let's plug this into the formula so I'm asking in effect I want to know what is the probability of the two girls given that we're going to have at least。

One girl。 Well， then this by the theorem tells me that this is the probability and I'm going to abbreviate even more and just go all the way down to one girl。

 I mean at least one girl， but I was write 1 G， given that I have two girls。😡。

Multipied by P of a here， P of a is the first thing， so multiplied by the probability of two girls。😡。

And then finally divide out by the probability of B。 So this is the probability of at least one girl。

 which I've abbreviated to be the probability of 1 g。 All right。

 so we have this computation so how can we actually go and evaluate it now。😡，Well。

 let's look at this conditional probability， the probability of having one girl， at least one girl。

 given that you know that there's two girls， but if you're being told that there's two girls。

And the probability of having at least one girls， 100%， if you have two girls。

 you have at least one of them。 So the P of 1 g given the 2G is really， really easy to compute。

 it's 100% or it's just the value of one。 I don't have to do anything。 Okay， a lot of sites。

 What about the probability of there being two girls， Well。

 you might remember that the four cases or you could have a girl girl， you could have a girl boy。

 you could have a boy girl and you could have a boy， boy。

 There was some four different sort of possibilities。But then if we're going to investigate this。

 we want to investigate what's the probability of having two girls， well。

 there's only one of those four possibilities so this is just going to be the value of a quarter。😡。

And then I divide out by the probability of at least one girl well this one has a girl and that one has a girl and at that one。

 there's three of them that have a girl， so three quarters， in other words， we get one third。

 which is the same value that we computed just by pure conditional probability。

 but we verified that it works using base theorem that illustrates at least some motivation at base theorem is likely going to be true and useful presumably in other context beyond this。
