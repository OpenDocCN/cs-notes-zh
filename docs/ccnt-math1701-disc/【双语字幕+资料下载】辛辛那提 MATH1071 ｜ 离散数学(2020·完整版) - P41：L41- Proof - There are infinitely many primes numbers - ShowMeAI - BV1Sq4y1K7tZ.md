In this videoÔºå we are going to prove a delightful theorem that there are infinitely many prime numbers„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_2.png)

So before we jump into the proof of thisÔºå let's just remind ourselves about the terminology„ÄÇ

 so I am going to claim that a positive integer is called prime when it has two different factors„ÄÇ

 one and itself„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_4.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_5.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_6.png)

SoÔºå for exampleÔºå two has one and two is factors and three has one and three is factors and five is one and five is factors„ÄÇ

 Note that one is not called prime because wellÔºå it has one in itself„ÄÇ those are not distinct things„ÄÇ

 So two distinct factorsÔºå one in itself„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_8.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_9.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_10.png)

And then we can talk about a composite number which is going to be a positive integer„ÄÇ

 which is greater than oneÔºå but that is not going to be prime„ÄÇ

 so this is a number like six where six has one and six is factors but it also has two and it also has three as factors„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_12.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_13.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_14.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_15.png)

I'll also note that we have a pleasing theoremÔºå which is that if you have a composite number„ÄÇ

 it can always be written out as a product of prime numbers for exampleÔºå if I take a number like 12„ÄÇ

Then 12 can be written as a product of prime numbers as twoÔºå which is prime times two„ÄÇ

 which is prime that gets me to fourÔºå and then multiplication by three„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_17.png)

All rightÔºå so now let's think about how we might prove this claim„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_19.png)

NowÔºå we have a similar problem to when we were trying to show that there was no integer that was even or not„ÄÇ

 which is„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_21.png)

I could go on for a while finding new integers after new prime numbers after new prime numbers„ÄÇ

 right I might go and find 19 and I might find 23 and I could carry on that process for a really really long time„ÄÇ

 I could carry it for the rest of my life„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_23.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_24.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_25.png)

But just because I'm always able to keep finding new prime numbers„ÄÇ

 doesn't really prove that there's infinitely many is's just maybe I haven't run out of time yet„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_27.png)

So proving this directly is a little bit challenging„ÄÇ

 it's going to be much easier to prove it by contradiction„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_29.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_30.png)

And the idea of contradiction here is that I'm going to begin by assuming there's finitely many primes„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_32.png)

And then I'm going to use that assumption that there's finitely many primes to get some sort of nonsensical statement„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_34.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_35.png)

And that's going to tell me that my assumption had to be false and therefore indeed there was infinitely many primes„ÄÇ

 so this is going to be sort of the logical structure that we're going to use a proof by contradiction All right„ÄÇ

 so let's actually see the proof my beginning is going to be that I have finitely many primes so I'm going assume that there are finite many primes„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_37.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_38.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_39.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_40.png)

NowÔºå whenever I do something like thisÔºå I've assumed a finite number of them„ÄÇ

 I may as well give them some namesÔºå well I can't give them all sort of unique names„ÄÇ

 but suppose that my finite number there was n of themÔºå some finite number N„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_42.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_43.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_44.png)

Then I could give them these namesÔºå I could give them piece of one„ÄÇ

 piece of two all the way down to PNÔºå those are my N different finite numbers of primes„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_46.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_47.png)

NowÔºå the way this proof is going to work is that I'm going to give you some new expression„ÄÇ

 an expression built out of these P1 down to PM„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_49.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_50.png)

And then that new thing that we're going to get is going to turn out it's going to be both prime and not prime„ÄÇ

 which is a nonsensical statement„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_52.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_53.png)

So here it isÔºå I'm going to consider a new symbolÔºå it's the symbol P that doesn't have any subscript„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_55.png)

And what P is is it's the product of all of those finite primes plus one„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_57.png)

So what do I know about itÔºå WellÔºå first of allÔºå this P is certainly bigger than all the other primes„ÄÇ

 right The multiplication of all these primes gets bigger and biggerÔºå the more I multiply things„ÄÇ

 And then I add another one on the end for good measure„ÄÇ So for sure„ÄÇ

 this is bigger than all of these other primes„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_59.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_60.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_61.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_62.png)

And if I think of listing these primes kind of like in order„ÄÇ

 like two times three times 5 times  sevenÔºå times 11Ôºå and so on„ÄÇ

 P is some number bigger than all of these different primes„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_64.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_65.png)

So in other wordsÔºå because it's bigger than them allÔºå I can conclude that it can't be on the list„ÄÇ

 it's not one of those primes it's bigger than all the primes so what we have is it's not a prime number or another way of saying it„ÄÇ

 I have it that it is a composite number„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_67.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_68.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_69.png)

OkayÔºå so I've written out this composite number„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_71.png)

WellÔºå if it's compositeÔºå then we could factor it by that theorem we were just talking about„ÄÇ

 we could factor it as a product of different primes„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_73.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_74.png)

As in this P that we have is some product of like the P1Ôºå the P2 might be a bunch of them„ÄÇ

 but some combination of these primesÔºå that's what it means to be composite is that there is some prime factorization of it„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_76.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_77.png)

OkayÔºå wellÔºå how about I try dividing out my P by P1„ÄÇ

 I'll do that off on the side here to give us some intuition here„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_79.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_80.png)

So I'm going to take this P1Ôºå P2 all the way down to PNÔºå and I'm going to take plus one„ÄÇ

And then I'm going to take the entire thingÔºå and I'm going to divide it out by P1„ÄÇ

Could have divide it up by P2Ôºå could divide it up by P3Ôºå could divide it up by Pn„ÄÇ

 but I just chose P1„ÄÇ

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_82.png)

OkayÔºå so how's that going to work outÔºå WellÔºå the P one is going cancel the first thing here„ÄÇ

 It's is gonna be P2 product all the way down to P N„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_84.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_85.png)

And then I get a remainder hereÔºå one divided out by P1„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_87.png)

This portion of it's an integer„ÄÇBut this person is not the P1 is some positive integer„ÄÇ

This is some remainder hereÔºå so what I get out of this is not an integer„ÄÇSo what have I said„ÄÇ

 this P that I have hereÔºå it's not divisible by P1Ôºå P1 is not a factor of it„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_89.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_90.png)

But I could have done the same argument for P2 right it would have been P1 P3 down to PN plus1 over P2 I get the same argument for P3 all the way down to PM none of these primes divide this and give me an integer or in other words„ÄÇ

 none of these primes are a factor for this composite number that's what my next conclusion is„ÄÇ



![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_92.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_93.png)

![](img/307945cce2bad72d0e034bf9aaab26d9_94.png)

But if none of the primes are going to be a factor„ÄÇ

 that means that the only factor is one and itselfÔºå in other wordsÔºå the P that I have is prime„ÄÇ

But hold onÔºå I've just told you that my P was prime and my P was not prime„ÄÇ

 but that's a contradiction„ÄÇ I can't have something being both prime and not prime„ÄÇ It's impossible„ÄÇ

So what I've done by these separate analysis is get to a contradiction„ÄÇ

So if I've gotten a contradiction that tells me that my initial assumptionÔºå that was the problem„ÄÇ

 my initial assumption was false because if I assumed it was true I got to garbled nonsense„ÄÇ

 so indeed my assumption must be false and if it's false that there are finitely many primes„ÄÇ

 it's therefore going to be true that there are infinitely many primes and so I have proven there are infinitely many primes„ÄÇ
