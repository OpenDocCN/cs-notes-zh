Let's investigate this sequence we were just looking at a little bit more carefully。

 because I want to give a different view on what a sequence really is。

Now currently I have it written here horizontally， but I could also go and switch it around and write it vertically as well that shouldn't make any difference。

 it's still an infinite ordered list。

And I also have another one that we've seen before， this is the one， two， three，4， five， six， seven。

 eight， and so on。

So we can think of these as two different sequences。

But because I've sort of lined them up in this nice way。

 we should have this association that like the one over here is associated to the three in the sense that they're both the first terms and the two here and the minus6 are associated in the sense that they're both the second terms。

And I can think of this as a sort of a dynamic way。

 I can think of it as the one goes to the three and the two goes to the6 and the three goes to the not。

Indeed， the association between here is precisely what that explicit formula tells me。

 if I choose a different k， it goes to the minus1 to the k times 3 k。



![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_15.png)

So what do I really have here， Well， if I think about my sequences as being my a diagram。

 when I've got a domain here， and I've got a code domain。

 and then the elements inside of my domain are all map two things in my code domain。

 what I'm describing is a function。😡。

![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_17.png)

Every single thing in my domain goes somewhere and more importantly， it obeys the vertical line test。

 there's no element in my domain here that splits into multiple different things。

 because my association is to take one element， say the Ca1 to the Cath one over here。

 not two different ones。So really what a sequence is going to be then is this function from this particular set to some other set。



![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_19.png)

Or in other words， I'm going to say this is my formal， mathematically precise definition。

 a sequence is a function where I'm taking things from the positive integers that was the one，2，3，4。

 and I'm going to some code domain that we haven't specified in the other example it looked like it was integers as well。

 but it's going to be some code domain。😡。

![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_22.png)

So as an example， let's take the one we just looked at。



![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_24.png)

If I want to describe it in this language， the language is of a function with a domain and with a code domain。

 what I'm going to say is that I have a function F。And it inputs things inside of my code domain。

 so it's going to input some k。😡，And then I had to tell you what it does to the K。 Well。

 it does precisely what we just saw。 It's got that minus1 to the K times 3 K。

 This could be an example。

![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_26.png)

![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_27.png)

In other words， if I think of it as a function， it inputs the K and it spits out this a subK。



![](img/198b1c44853c641082ed3f6a7175e1d5_29.png)

Now， this formal definition of a function， I want us to note it and to be there and for us to think that sequences really aren't anything new。

 they're just a special type of function。 However， it's really intuitively useful to us if we actually think of sequences more in the informal sense。

 that there're this ordered list of numbers。 In other words。

 I typically don't use the F of k notation at all。 when I'm denoting a sequence， I will say a sub K。

 the K term in my sequence， and that'll give the formula that depends on K。

 and I don't make explicit that I'm talking about a function and I' will make explicit a particular f。

 However， that is what is going on behind the idea of a sequence。😡。
