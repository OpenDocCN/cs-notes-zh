。Suppose I have some graph。 And I want to walk through this graph。

 Well what I mean by that is I want to start on some particular vertex。

 I go along an edge to a different vertex。 I go along an edge to a different vertex and so on。 Now。

 there is a special name for certain types of ways that I can move through graphs like this。

 An eer path is one that starts at a vertex。 and it moves along through the graph where every edge is taken up exactly one time。

 not0， not two times。 Every edge in the entire graph is used exactly once。 That is an oiluler path。😊。

And an oiler circuit is the same idea。 The same。 Everything had to be hit once。

 but you start and finish at the exact same vertex。 So it makes a loop。

 And then we call it an Euler circuit。 instead of an oiluler path that might start somewhere。

 go through and end up somewhere else。 Let's see one example of this。

 Let me start at the value of A here。 I'll highlight it。 I then walk down to C。 I walk over to B。

 Maybe I go back up to A。 I go back down to B。 I go down to D here。 I go， baby。

 I don't know back up to B。But then I have a problem because。

While I have gone along and I've used up almost all the edges exactly once。

 there's still one edge that's missing this connection between D and C。

But how do I get there Because right now I'm hanging out over at B？

And bees got every one of its five different edges that leaves from bees already being used it's already gonna highlight it。

 I've done my Ouler path and walked over them once already so if I wanted to get down to D to C。

 I'd have to go over an edge I've already done So in other words。

 I can't actually get there via an Eer path or an Euler circuit。So in this particular graph。

 at least the path that I chose， I wasn't able to go and do everything once。

 Now you can pause the video if you like and see whether you can find some path that gets through here that does hit everything。

😡，But even if you don't get a path and I didn't get one when I tried to do it。

 that maybe there's still somebody out there who's creative enough that could find one。

 So is it impossible。 Well， it turns out it is impossible。

 and we're going to use a little theorem about Euler circuits。 and the theorem says this。

 It says that if you have a graph with an Euler circuit。 So one that starts at a vertex goes around。

 gets back to the same place and hits every edge once。😡，Well。

 then every vertex in that graph must have even degree。 Why is that true。

 So I've given a little small portion of a graph。's got a vertex and has got edges leaving it。

 And this is not a graph by itself。 It has a whole bunch of other vertices around there。

 but I' just not show them up。 just gonna zoom in on this one vertex。

So imagine that I'm going through I'm doing my Ouler circuit and I get to this particular vertex A。

 so I come in and maybe go along from the top left and I hit out this value of a。😡，Okay。

 so I've got to the A now I have to leave， so maybe I'll go out the bottom here so I leave and then I go off and do a bunch of other stuff in the graph。

 who knows？But eventually， because I want to hit every one of these edges exactly one time。

 I'm gonna have to come back in and I go in and get to a again。 But now I'm standing on a。

 I've come in and I've gone out。 and I've come in again。 And now I'm on a。 and I can't get out。

 I'm trapped。 if I want to leave a， I'd have to leave an edge， I've already covered。

 So I can't hit it exactly once。 And indeed， whether it was three or five or 7 doesn't matter as long as you。

 you can come in and go out， come in， go out， come in and go out any number of times that you want to do this even property coming in。

 coming out。But if there's an odd number at some point。

 you're going to come in and you will be trapped and you will not be able to leave。 And indeed。

 this is even true of A is your starting vertex。 right， let's say you start there。 Okay。

 well now you leave and come back， leave and come back， leave and come back。

 But if it's an odd number。 eventually， you have to leave。

 and you will not be able to come back that the euler circuit that has to return to its origin is not possible。

 By the way， if you have an euler path where you have a starting and ending vertex that are different。

 Then the starting in the ending actually have to be odd because your first is not a go and come back。

 it's just a go。 And then everything else is going to be a come back and go， come back and go。

 come back and go if you're that starting vertex。 However。

 all the ones in the middle do have to have an even degree to be an euler path。Now。

 I want to note that this is the statement of my theorem as an if then。

 and the contrapositive of that particular statement is that if you have a graph with an odd degree。

 any vertex at all， if there's even one vertex with an odd degree。

 then it's impossible that you do not have an oiluler circuit。😡。

So let's use that to study the particular graph that we started with。 Well， in this one。

 the degree of every one of these verdictes is going to be odd。 You only need one to break it。

 but every single one of them is bad。 So indeed， for this particular graph。

 there is no possible Euler circuit that goes through it。 Nor is there an oiluler path。

 two of the odd ones could become coming starting and finishing ones。

 but all the rest would have had to be even。 and they're all odd here。 So no oiluler pass。

 no oiluler circuits。By the way， this theorem， this if， then actually the converse of it is true。

 The it's an if and only if theorem that is， if you have a graph which has even degree。

 then it is possible to find an oular circuit。 although that argument is a little bit more sophisticated than I'm going to do in this video。

Now， let's return to the original problem that motivated all this graph theory and got us starting back a little while ago。

 And that was to say that this particular graph that I have here。

 it came up from this bridges of Kigsburg problem where I had this river and these two islands in the river in the two sides and then the ABCD that those were going to be my vertices for the four different land massessses。

 And I could cross over via the bridges and that was going to go and make my graph。 Now。

 the question was that when originally pose launched all of this graph theory was。

 can you go through these seven bridges of Kigsburg and travel them exactly once。

 And that's just asking， is it possible for you to have an Euler path or an Euler circuit that goes through these。

 And now we know that the answer is no， it is not possible because every one of these vertices is odd。

 It is not possible to have an oiluler circuit。
