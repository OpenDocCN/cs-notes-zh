In this video， we are going to look at the idea of sequences。

So a sequence in mathematics is just going to be some list of objects， very often a list of numbers。

 So for example， here's a few different sequences， how about this sequence， one，2，3，4。

 I think you get the pattern it would continue on like that。

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_4.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_5.png)

So in other words， it's this like infinite list， I'm claiming that this pattern carries on forever and that there's a definable pattern。

 even though I haven't written it down here， you could tell me what the next one was going to be。

 it's going to be five based on the pattern that I have。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_7.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_8.png)

There's， in fact， many such different examples， another one might be how about0，1，0，1，0，1， and so on？



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_10.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_11.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_12.png)

Now notice that this is different from our previous idea of a set in a set。

 things like order and repetition that those didn't matter and that this really was just a set of two elements。

 but that's not what I'm talking about， a sequence is something that's got a first thing。

 a second thing， a third thing and so on and here we have a first thing， a second thing。

 a third thing and it goes on forever in this kind of pattern。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_14.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_15.png)

So my informal notion of a sequence is this infinite ordered list of mathematical objects。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_17.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_18.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_19.png)

Note that I don't put numbers here。 The objects could be all kinds of weird mathematical things。

 although we normally deal with numbers。 So for example。

 I could have an ordered list of functions or an ordered list of sets or all kinds of different objects。

 but for the most part， we'll be dealing with an ordered list of numbers。😡，In the previous examples。

 we sort of picked up the pattern of the sequence just by looking at first couple terms。

 but sometimes what we do is write explicitly down what the formula for the particular sequence is going to be。

😡。

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_21.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_22.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_23.png)

So in order to do this， I need a little bit of notation， which is the symbol a subK。

And what a sub K is going to refer to， this is going to be the kfe term of my sequence。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_25.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_26.png)

So is the case term。So for example， a sub1 is the first term， A sub2 is the second term。

 and generally a sub K is the cake term。

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_28.png)

So if I want to have an explicit formula， what I need to do is I need to tell you what are all of the AKs。

 so I want to give as an example this。😡，I'm going to claim that a sub K is just equal to k。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_30.png)

Okay， so this is like the simplest one that I can imagine。

 So if I want to think about what this means for my sequence， then So what I'm saying is that a sub1。

 the first term is just one。 so that's this。😡。

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_32.png)

![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_33.png)

And then A sub two， which is my second term， is just two， so one， two， three， four， and continues on。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_35.png)

This is indeed just precisely the sequence that we saw before。

 but I can do much more interesting and convoluted ones here。 So for example。

 how about this I'll use BK this time because I'm doing a new series a new sequence rather。😡。

I'm going to say it is minus1。To the power of k multiplied by 3K。Okay。

 so let's try to write out the first few terms for this sequence。

 which has been defined by an explicit formula。😡，So the first one。

 if I look at the first term is k equal to 1。So minus1 to the k， that's going to be just a minus1。

 and then three times1。 so the first term is going to be minus3。

And then I'm going to look at the next term， so this is k equal to 2。 now it's minus1 squared。

 minus1 squared is positive one， so there's no negative sign， and then three times2 is going to be6。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_37.png)

Okay， I'll look at my next one， minus-1 cubed。 it's an odd power now。

 so this is going to bring out a -1 and then three times3 is going to be9， so minus9。

So there's a couple different components to think about here first of all there's the K which we've seen before。

 so the K sort of has like an underlying one， two， three， four。😡，But then that one， two， three。

 four gets multiplied by this extra three， so one， two， three turns into 36，9。

And then the interesting one is this minus1 to the K。

Because minus1 to the K depends on whether that K is even or odd。When it's even -1 to an even power。

 all of those are going to be just giving out the value of one， minus1 squared is1。

 minus1 to the fourth is one。But if I take the minus1 to an odd power。

 like minus1 to the 1 or minus1 to the three or minus1 to the5。

 all of those are going to give you a negative sign。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_39.png)

So as my K goes up 1，2，3，4， he's alter between whether it's odd or even so I get a minus sign and then I don't get a minus sign then I get a minus sign and I don't get a minus sign。

 So without even looking at it I can look at the next one it we go minus no minus minus it's gonna have no minus the next one and it's gonna to be four times3 so 12 and then the next one would be minus 15 and so on。

😡，So this problem can work two different ways， I can either give you the formula and you can write down the first few terms。

 or I can give you the first few terms and you can write down what the formula is going to be。😡。



![](img/e9cbc63dfb045d0486493ecd354aba5c_41.png)

By the way， every sequence doesn't necessarily have a nice explicit closed form formula， as they say。

 for instance， consider the sequence， which is all of the different decimals of pi pi is an irrational number it goes on forever and it never repeats。

 there's no nice simple formula to tell you what the seventh power of pi。嗯。

Theres no nice formula to tell you， say the seventh decimal place of pi。

 so we don't have this sort of clean way with a nice cute little formula to be able to describe every sequence。

 but a lot of sequences can be described this way。
