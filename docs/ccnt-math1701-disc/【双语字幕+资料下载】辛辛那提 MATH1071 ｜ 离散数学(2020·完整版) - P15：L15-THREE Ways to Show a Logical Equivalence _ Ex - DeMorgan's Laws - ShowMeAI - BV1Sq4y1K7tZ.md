In this videoÔºå I'm going to show you three different ways to argue that two different logical forms are actually logically equivalent„ÄÇ

 So what do I mean by thisÔºü I'm going to begin with a particular pair of logical forms„ÄÇ

 not P or Q and not P not Q And the question isÔºå are these two different things„ÄÇ

 the same or are they're going to be different„ÄÇ In fact„ÄÇ

 they're going to be the same and it's going to be a very important law and logic called de Morgan's law„ÄÇ

 But how can I figure that out„ÄÇ NowÔºå the first one I'm going to do is not really much a proof„ÄÇ

 but it's sort of test of reasonableness„ÄÇ I want to just make up some example„ÄÇ

 make up a P and make up a Q and see whether you can just sort of reason it through and get the result that makes it look equivalent„ÄÇ

 So for exampleÔºå what if I said to be P is trevors a unicorn and Q is trevor as a goldfish„ÄÇ

 something ridiculous„ÄÇNowÔºå if I think about the left hand side hereÔºå so the not P or Q„ÄÇ

 so P or Q stands for Trevor as a unicorn or Trevor is a goldfish„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

And then when you put a knot all the way out the front„ÄÇ

 what you're saying is that it is not the caseÔºå the Trevor is either a unicorn or a goldfish„ÄÇ

 That's one way I could come up with an English sentence for that logical expression„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 for the right hand oneÔºå I'm saying not P and not cues„ÄÇ In other words„ÄÇ

 I' am saying that I am not a unicorn and I am not a goldfish„ÄÇ NowÔºå it's a silly example„ÄÇ

 But if you look at these two different thingsÔºå Do you think that they are the same„ÄÇ

 They express the same idea or a different one„ÄÇ WellÔºå if I look at the left hand side„ÄÇ

 if I am saying it is not the case that I am either a unicorn or a goldfish„ÄÇ

 it really means I can't be either of those„ÄÇ which is basically what the right hand is saying as well„ÄÇ

 it's saying I can't be a unicorn and I can't be a goldfish„ÄÇ So it seems reasonable to me„ÄÇ

 But maybe you sayÔºå wellÔºå hold onÔºå that's not actually a proof I want something more„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 the way we had defined a logical equivalence was to sayÔºå go and look at the truth table„ÄÇ

 So here is this„ÄÇTruth table for the so called de Morgan's law„ÄÇ

 I set my P and Q to be a bunch of differentÔºå true and falses„ÄÇ

 I have some intermediate values that I've put hereÔºå like the not P and the not Q and the P or Q„ÄÇ

 Then finallyÔºå the final two columns are the left hand side and the right hand side„ÄÇ

 And you'll notice that because they match because it's falseÔºå falseÔºå falseÔºå true„ÄÇ

That that means these two different sides are logically equivalent by definition„ÄÇ

 So this is the more formal proof of the reasonable tests that our sort of English sentences gave us„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå there are an enormous number of these logical equivalences out there„ÄÇ

 There's a couple that are pretty major and we can list them off by name„ÄÇ This one that I did„ÄÇ

 de Morgangan's lawÔºå but there's actually two versions of De Morgangan's law where you permute the or and the an statement„ÄÇ

 But we've seen previouslyÔºå we had a double negative law„ÄÇ

 We had a truth table showed the negation of the negation of P was P„ÄÇ

 And then when we talked about tautologies and contradictions„ÄÇ

 There are also a bunch of different laws that applied there„ÄÇ

 Theres these identity laws that said if you took something like P or a contradiction„ÄÇ That's just P„ÄÇ

 or these universal bound laws like that P or a tautology was a taology„ÄÇ

 And there's many more that I haven't put up on this list„ÄÇ

So this brings me into my third way of showing a logical equivalence„ÄÇ

 You don't always have to go back to a truth table„ÄÇ If you want to„ÄÇ

 now that you know all of these are logical equivalence is you can cite them in the proof of a new logical equivalence„ÄÇ

 Let me show you what I mean by this„ÄÇ Let me begin with this messy statement over here„ÄÇ

 What I'm going to try to do is clean it upÔºå Manip into some other logical statement„ÄÇ

 But where all of my manipulations are the rules that we just saw on the previous slide„ÄÇ

 that is I'm not doing a truth tableÔºå I am applying a list of rules„ÄÇ So when I look at this thing„ÄÇ

 many ways that could start„ÄÇ But the first is I could see I could apply a door Morgans in the middle„ÄÇ

 there is a noÔºå and then theres an or' statement of two different things„ÄÇ So let me do that„ÄÇ

 Let me apply my Morgans law„ÄÇ So what happens the not goes in front of the P„ÄÇ

 The or flips to an and statement„ÄÇ And then finallyÔºå the left hand side of the right hand side„ÄÇ

 there was this not cu„ÄÇ So when you bring the new no in what you get„ÄÇIs not cute„ÄÇüò°ÔºåAnd then finally„ÄÇ

 the and theatology on the out hand side„ÄÇ I haven't touched that one at all„ÄÇ OkayÔºå well„ÄÇ

 now I could do a double negative thing„ÄÇ I have a not no Q here„ÄÇ

 So let me apply my double negative rule„ÄÇ And so this is just not P and Q„ÄÇ And then finally„ÄÇ

 and aatology„ÄÇOkayÔºå it's already gotten a little bit cleaner„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 what about this thing where I've got a big thing in brackets„ÄÇ And then I put and atuttology„ÄÇ

 Can I clean that upÔºå WellÔºå one of the rules we had beforeÔºå then identity rules„ÄÇ

 if you have any statementÔºå you go and a tautology„ÄÇ

 that is exactly the true and exactly false based on the original statement„ÄÇ

 But and a taology part doesn't do anything„ÄÇ So by this identity law„ÄÇ

 we can just get rid of the and a taology thingÔºå So now we clean it up when we say this is logically equivalent to not P and cute„ÄÇ

So the point here is that you don't always have to go back to a truth table which can be somewhat long cumbersome if you have this list of known logical equivalences„ÄÇ

 you can apply them in sequenceÔºå citing the name of the logical equience as you do„ÄÇ

 and you're able to take one logical form and manipulate it into a different logical form„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ
