I'm excited because in this video， we are going to do our first formal mathematical proof。

And I have a kind of straightforward claim。 The claim is that the sum of an even and an odd integer is。

 in fact， an odd integer。 Like， for example，2 plus 3， that's an even and an odd。

 And it adds up to Phi， which is another odd。 Now， that seems straightforward。

 But are you 100 per convinced that this theorem is true for every possible way you can do it。

 Every possible you can add an even to an odd。 And more importantly， if I'm a skepticic。

 could you convince me of that。 So this is the point of this video。

 I'm going to show you the basic scaffolds for how you can do a formal direct proof。

 how you can get started and how you can complete it。 The actual theorem doesn't matter so much。

 It's just a particular example of the structure of a simple， direct proof。

 And then we're going to go on in this course。 I'm going to see all kinds of different formal proofs of all kinds of different claims。

😊，Okay， so let's get started in actually proving this。

The first thing I want to do is that I want to be precise about what we're actually saying here and what my definitions are。

 And in the previous video， we saw the definition of being even and being odd and there they are。😡。

We would say that an integer N was even if there was some other integer K where n was twice K。

 and we'd say that an integer N was odd。 if there was some other integer K。

 such that your n was twice K plus one。 So these are the two major words that are sort of mathhy in this particular theorem。

 And before you even get started proving any theorem。

 you have to have a precise definition of the concepts that are in that particular theorem。All right。

 so now let's try to prove this particular claim。Now， the first thing I want to note is this。

 This claim is written in the form of if P then Q。 It says if you have some assumptions， namely。

 you've got an even integer and an odd inger， then you get a conclusion that the sum of those two things is an odd integer。

 So it's saying if you've got an M and an N， that's even an odd， then you add the M and the N。

 and you get an odd。 So when I want to do this proof。 If it goes， if some assumptions。

 then a conclusion， my proof should follow that basic logic when I'm doing a direct proof。

 I want to begin with the assumptions。I'm to go on and follow some process。

 And then I'm going end with the conclusion。 And so when you read it， everything makes sense。

 you start with what you're supposed to assume and you do various manipulations and you get to what you're trying to conclude。

 That is how you do a direct proof。 So in this case。 Well， what's my assumption， It's the M is even。

 And that the N is odd。 And that's what I'm going to begin with。

 So that's going to be my very first line in my proof。 Let M be even and N be odd。😡，All right。 Now。

 the problem right now is that the M being even and the N being odd is still a little bit imprecise。

 but thankfully， we've already defined the precise notion of what it means to be even an odd to be even。

 it says that there is some integer K such that M can be written as twice K to be odd。

 It means that there is some other integer K so that n can be written as twice K plus one。😊，However。

 because I've got two different numbers here， the M and the N， you get two different ks。

 I'm going actually call them K1 and K2。 And so when I apply my formal definition here it is。

 it says there is an integer K1， And there is another integer K2。

 And that is what lets you write M as twice K1 and N as twice K2 plus 1。

 So this is the precise mathematical definitions of being even and odd。 Now。

 why do I care about this， because now I can plug these into formulas in particular。

 the theorem that I have here asks for the sum of these two things。

 I'm trying to make a claim about the sum of M plus M。

So I'm going to take the sum of M plus and I'm going to substitute in precisely these definitions。

 So what do I get， I get M plus n here is twice K1 plus。😡，Twice K2 plus 1。

And then if I do this little bit of manipulation， I can bring a two out of the factors。

 I can say this is twice times k1 plus K2 plus1。 So basically I just applied my definition here to the sum。

 and then I just did a little bit of algebra to pull a two out。😡，Now， why did I do a bit of algebra？

What I'm trying to do， where I'm going is that I want the sum of M plus n to be an odd integer。

 So I want the sum of n plus n to be written as twice an integer plus 1。 Well。

 it sort of is it's written as twice something plus1。 The something is K1 plus K2。

 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into find a third K， I'm going to define find a K3。

 and the K3 is the sum of the K1 and the K2。 And by the way， since K1 was an integer。

 K2 is an integer and the sum of two integers is an integer。 K3 is also an integer。 Now。

 why do I like that。 Well， what have I done here， I now I'm in a position to write the definition of the conclusion that is I can say that I've got a K3 such that M plus n。

 the sum of these two things can be written as twice K3 plus1。

And that's just a different way of saying that M plus n is an odd integer， so that's it。

 that's the end of my proof， and I can put this little QE box to denote that I'm at the end of my proof。

😡，Okay， so let's think about the structure of this。 Well we've started at the beginning。

 We've gone to the end。 I am now compelled to believe that indeed， in every scenario。

 the sum of an even and an nod has to be an odd。 This proof is what convinces me of that particular claim。

The way it worked was that at the beginning and at the end， what do I have， Well。

 I have the assumption going down to the conclusion。 I began at the beginning。 I ended at the end。

 So that part was good。 And this should always be the first and last line of any proof that you're right。

 Heck， you can even go and write the end of your proof before you do anything in the middle。

 If you so choose， because， you know where you're trying to go to is the conclusion。

But then I have the green stuff。 and the green， the first green is the definition of my assumptions。

 And the final one is the definition of my conclusion。

 So the the assumption of the conclusion might be right in a little bit vaguely。

 They might use a math terminology。 But when I'm making an actual proof。

 I want to have those ideas expressed clearly with formal definitions。

 And so that's what the greens going represent。 And then the pink stuff in the middle。

 The pink is my manipulations。 In this case， I took a sum。 I plugged the definitions in。

 I factored out the two。 I defined this K 3。 That's sort of the body of the proof。😊。

So this basic structure that I have here， it repeats itself in proof after proof after proof that you're going to have this five step process。

 in fact， where you state the assumption， you state the definition of the assumption。

 You do a bunch of manipulations。 You get to the definition of the conclusion。 and finally。

 you state the conclusion。😡，Now， the actual definitions change to prove to proof and the actual assumptions and conclusions change。

 proved to prove。 But steps 1，2，4， and 5 are all kind of a bit for free。

 You can sort of write them down。 And if you know what your definition definitions are。

 you can get most of the structure of the proof。 What's the hard part is the manipulations。

 And that changes is different for every single proof。 In this case。

 we had a relatively simple manipulation。 But in some proofs， it can be very challenging。

Final point about this introduction to proofs。 This is for socalled direct proofs。

 proofs of the claim where you're saying for every value in some domain。

 you're saying the p of x's imply the Q of x's。 And you're starting with your assumption P and you're going towards your conclusion。

 Q。 This is a for all style statement。 And there's other types of proofs out there。 First of all。

 you might have a different order to how you prove things， for example。

 you could prove things by contradictpositive or contradiction。 We're going to learn them later。

 you can have existential proofs opposed to these sort of for all proofs。 But in this case。

 as's a for all proof because we're saying for every possible M that's even in every possible M that's odd。

 Then your sum is going to be odd as well。 So this five step method for direct proofs。

 I hope will serve you very well。 And you're gonna have a whole bunch of different types of proofs that are using this basic structure。
