Because sets and the set operations like union and intersection and complement are all defined in terms of some logical condition like or or and or not in„ÄÇ

 it means that all of those rules of logic that we got„ÄÇ

 all of those logical equivalencies can be applied to the language of sets„ÄÇ

 and therefore we get a lot of equi of sets„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

So for exampleÔºå consider this claimÔºå I'm claiming that a union B equals B union A„ÄÇ



![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_8.png)

So how could we prove a claim like this againÔºå I want you to notices inequality so I want to show if it's in the Union A union B„ÄÇ

 then it's in the B union A and vice versaÔºå if it's in B union AÔºå then it's in A union B„ÄÇ

 I want to show both sides of that so I want to say show that when my proof is going forward„ÄÇ

 everything is in biconal and if and only if„ÄÇ

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_13.png)

So when I'm going to use the element methodÔºå nameÔºå I'm going to start with an element X„ÄÇ

 which is inside of the A and the BÔºå it's inside of a union B„ÄÇ



![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_15.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_16.png)

But the definition of a union BÔºå and by the wayÔºå all definitions are inherently if and only if„ÄÇ

 so you don't have to worry about that if you're applying a definitionÔºå it is always if an only if„ÄÇ



![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_18.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_19.png)

So x is an a union B is the same thing as x is an A„ÄÇ



![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_21.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_22.png)

Or I'm going to put this symbol for my disjunctive or X is inside of B„ÄÇ

But now we can use a property that we had for disjunctives„ÄÇ

 we know that two properties that are connected with an or that I can reverse that order„ÄÇ

 that I can say that this is the same thing as X inside of B or X is inside of A Indeed back in the day we would have verified this logical property by looking at it at level of truth tables„ÄÇ

 this is P or Q and this is Q or P and you can verify that they have the same truth table„ÄÇ

 so this is a logical equivalence„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_24.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_25.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_26.png)

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_27.png)

And then I can go backwards„ÄÇ X and B or X and A„ÄÇ This is precisely the same thing as saying that x is in B union A„ÄÇ

 And so I have a chain of if and only if„ÄÇ and I get if I start in a union BÔºå I end up in B union A„ÄÇ

 And the key thing to note here is that the important property is something about logic„ÄÇ

 the reversing the order came down here as a logical property„ÄÇ

 And then because the union was defined in terms of this or statement„ÄÇ

 you could sort of bring it out of the logical property into this statement about unions„ÄÇ

 But the same is true in a much larger domain„ÄÇ For instanceÔºå we have a de Morgangan's law for logic„ÄÇ

 we have a de Morgangan's law for sets„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/359bcc42415fc1c002b2e551fb421f3a_35.png)

And that idea is going to continue for all of the different logical equivalencies„ÄÇ
