In this videoÔºå I want to look at an example of induction that has an inequality unit it„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_2.png)

IndeedÔºå we're trying to show that two to the power of n is bigger than n for all values of n greater than equal to0„ÄÇ

 By the wayÔºå theres many different text techniques to do thisÔºå you can do this using calculus„ÄÇ

 but in this video we're going to do it via induction„ÄÇ Now induction is a couple different steps„ÄÇ

 The analogy I always use climbing the ladderÔºå we have to be able to get onto the first rung of a ladder a basis step and then we have to know that if we're on the K throng of the ladder that we can climb to the K plus one rung of the ladder„ÄÇ

 And if both of those two things are trueÔºå then we're able to climb our ladder„ÄÇ So first up„ÄÇ

 this is going to be the basis step„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_5.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_6.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_7.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_8.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_9.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_10.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_11.png)

And the basis step is in most examples a little bit easy„ÄÇ

 you just plug in whatever your sort of starting point is and see that it's clearly true„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_13.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_14.png)

So we're claiming that this is true for all n greater than0„ÄÇ

 so let's try plugging in n equal to0 and see what we get IndeedÔºå2 to the power of zero„ÄÇ

 that's just oneÔºå two to any value to the power of zero is1„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_16.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_17.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_18.png)

And then the claim isÔºå is this greater than just plugging in n equal to zeroÔºå well„ÄÇ

 one is indeed zeroÔºå so the basis here is true„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_20.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_21.png)

All rightÔºå so that's lovelyÔºå I'm definitely glad about thatÔºå but let us continue„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_23.png)

After we've done our basis stepÔºå what we next need to do is our induction hypothesis„ÄÇ

 this is assuming it's true at the KF levelÔºå and then we're going to show that it's true at the K plus1 level„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_25.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_26.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_27.png)

So I am going to use my induction hypothesis„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_29.png)

And what I'm doing is effectively just putting this formula in„ÄÇ

 but for the particular value k so I in other words„ÄÇ

 I am going to assume that2 to the power of k is going to be greater than k and this is going to work for some value of k which is greater than equalizer or I don't know what value it is„ÄÇ

 but some value„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_31.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_32.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_33.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_34.png)

All rightÔºå so that's what I'm going to assumeÔºå that's what I'm allowed to use„ÄÇ

 but now I want to do the all important induction step„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_36.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_37.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_38.png)

NowÔºå the way that this works is that„ÄÇI want to show something true at the K+1 level„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_40.png)

As in what I want to do is I want to begin and I want to look at two to the power of k plus1„ÄÇ

 and I want to do a bunch of work here„ÄÇ I might have to do a whole bunch of tricky manipulations„ÄÇ

 but what I eventually want to get is that this two to the K plus1 is going to be greater than K plus1„ÄÇ

 And if that's the caseÔºå I've shown that this is true of the K plus one wrongg„ÄÇ

 that the two to the K plus1 is greater than K plus1„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so how do I connect these dots„ÄÇ

 this is where I'm hoping to go„ÄÇ I'm hoping to get down here„ÄÇ

 but all I'm beginning with is the left hand side the two to the K plus1„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_42.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_43.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_44.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_45.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_46.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_47.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_48.png)

The first sort of algebraic trick that sticks out to me here is that this can be thought of as2 multiplied by  two to the power just of K„ÄÇ

 IndeedÔºå this is one of our exponential rules that A to the B times a to the C is a to the B plus C„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_50.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_51.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_52.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_53.png)

Now part of the reason why I did this is that what I'm really interested in is identifying this two to the power of k because I know something about2 to the power of k„ÄÇ

 that's something that we can use our assumption„ÄÇ so I can say2 to the K is greater than K so this is going to be greater„ÄÇ

 the first two comes along for the ride and then it's multiplied by K„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_55.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_56.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_57.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_58.png)

Now rememberÔºå we're trying to get thisÔºå say that this is bigger than k plus1 where we're y to show that 2 k is bigger than k plus 1 might seem obvious this is the case„ÄÇ

 but I want to be completely sure of this so first of all„ÄÇ

2K this is going to be thought of as just k plus k Now remember our goal is to say that this2k2 to the power of k plus1 is bigger than k plus1 currently I've got it bigger than k plus k„ÄÇ

 but k is in general going to be bigger than1 indeed„ÄÇ

 this is going to be bigger than k plus1 any time that we have k being something which is greater than1„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_60.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_61.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_62.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_63.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_64.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_65.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_66.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_67.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_68.png)

Now this gives me a sort of interesting pointÔºå as in if you look at my induction hypothesis„ÄÇ

 I assumed was2 to the K was greater than k for k greater than zero„ÄÇ

 notice how I put that k greater than zero then„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_70.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_71.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_72.png)

But I then thought that was reasonable at the timeÔºå but Id carried on this computation„ÄÇ

 as I've carried on this computationÔºå I realized that what I'm really interested in is it being K greater than one„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_74.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_75.png)

So that's okayÔºå I can deal with the K equal to zero and in fact I can deal with the k equal to1 case individually„ÄÇ

 I'm going to take my induction I apologize it was a reasonable guess and instead make it the K greater than one that we need and in this case„ÄÇ

 then our methodology works„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_77.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_78.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_79.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_80.png)

So what we're effectively saying is we can get from the K step to the K plus one step by this little bit of trickery as long as we are bigger than the value of one„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_82.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_83.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_84.png)

So we've discovered the slight is symmetry in the indexingÔºå but if we want to„ÄÇ

 we can come all the way back to our original basis hereÔºå and we can just add in a few extra ones„ÄÇ

 we can also note thatÔºå for exampleÔºå2 to the one is greater than oneÔºå that's for sure true„ÄÇ

 we can note that2 to the twoÔºå which is four is greater than twoÔºå that's for sure true„ÄÇ

 So we can do those low value of K casesÔºå until such time as we get being bigger than the value of one„ÄÇ



![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_86.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_87.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_88.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_90.png)

![](img/6a27c0f31aa42e71025f47ff9be36066_91.png)

So I believe we have now proven it by mathematical inductionÔºå we've established these basis cases„ÄÇ

 these initial onesÔºå we've assumed it's true at the K level and we've proven it's true at the K plus1 level„ÄÇ

 we've proven that two to the K plus1 is indeed bigger than K plus1 and along this route we had to deal with this little messy detail of the index where it started„ÄÇ

 but the big structure is the same and it's the same for every one of these different induction problems„ÄÇ
