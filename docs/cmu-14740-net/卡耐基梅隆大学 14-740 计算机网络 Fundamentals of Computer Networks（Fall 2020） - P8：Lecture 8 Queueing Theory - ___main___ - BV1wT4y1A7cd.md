This is 14740Ôºå welcome everybody„ÄÇToday we're going to tackle a fairly interesting and somewhat challenging topic„ÄÇ

That is queuing theory is„ÄÇBy farÔºå the most math heavy„ÄÇ

ÂóØ„ÄÇThis hasÔºå I don't knowÔºå more math thanÔºå yeah it's just„ÄÇSoÔºå I„ÄÇ

I hope that doesn't scare anybody okay it's not difficult math„ÄÇ

 we do have some big sigmas and pies and a couple probability things here and there„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇ

What I'm not trying to do is I'm not trying to make you into queing theory experts who can you know go„ÄÇ

You earn a living doing queuing theory somewhereÔºå but I just want to introduce you to this topic because it is a very important tool in the network engineers toolkit as you are constructing systems or analyzing systems or trying to figure out what the performance of a network system is going to be definitely but also this is useful tool in lots of other analysis places when you're trying to figure out other parts of your system will your operating system be able to handle loads and things like that and so an introduction„ÄÇ

 I almost said gentle introduction but it probably isn't gentle based on the amount of math we have here„ÄÇ

A couple of administrative points before we get startedÔºå one of them is„ÄÇ

I hope you know by now that next lesson is going to be the quiz okay the quiz will be delivered on Canva so those of you here in economy don't show up here next time I guess you could you could sit here and work through the exam if you wanted to but I won't be here I'll be on zoom so if you have any questions you can ask during the quiz„ÄÇ

But you knowÔºå basically go to someplace comfortableÔºå get very relaxed„ÄÇ

Be in a state of mind that will help you with that quiz„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

There is a study guide on the website now that study guide you should have seen all the content in that before because it is literally just the last couple slides of every lecture where I talk about the lesson objectives for that lesson„ÄÇ

And I have combined them all together in chronological order right and then you this is basically a list of what I think you ought to be able to do„ÄÇ

The quiz itself will cover queuing theory so everything up to and including today everything you have heard in this course is fair game that does include material„ÄÇ

I think it would be fair gameÔºå although probably a little bit weird to ask you questions about your wire shark I certainly am not going to ask you with's this button or what's that„ÄÇ

 but I could conceive of a question relating to that somehow certainly the readings are fair game now„ÄÇ

I also recognize that you read a lot of papers and there's a lot of stuff in there and I'm not going to go in and ask you for some little detail I'm not going to say you know in the Kazza study figure four had this graph you know was a „ÄÇ

2 or „ÄÇ7 at the top of that graph„ÄÇI would consider that too minute a detail to worry about„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 if there's some topic in the paperÔºå let's say you out of an eight or 10 page paper„ÄÇ

 if there's a topic that covers a page„ÄÇüò°ÔºåWhere the author is describing somethingÔºå if there's„ÄÇ

 you know that like figure two of the paper that talks about the architecture for the entire system„ÄÇ

 I think some of those are fair game sorts of questions„ÄÇ

 the sort of thing that if you read the paper you really should not have missed„ÄÇ

That particular piece and the sort of thing you you„ÄÇ

You might not have chosen it as an important point„ÄÇ

 but a lot of students in the class would have chosen as an important point to discuss„ÄÇ

The book the quiz itself is closed book close notes„ÄÇ

 you will be able to use the equation sheet that covers all the equations we have today you'll notice in today's lesson objectives one of the lesson objectives is says the student at this point should be able to not memorize all the equations okay I don't want you to memorize and that's a pointless exercise in memize memorization what I want you to be able to do is you have that reference sheet next to you be able to apply the appropriate equation pick out the appropriate equation„ÄÇ

 understand the terminology behind the equations okay„ÄÇIf you're doing math„ÄÇ

 no calculators can be requiredÔºå I will have chosen numbers nicely so that you're dividing by 10 or multiplying by four sorts of things„ÄÇ

 you will not have to do long division or anything like that okay„ÄÇ

I also want to point out that we do have a couple other things in the mix that are coming up„ÄÇ

 there's a homework that's due the time after the quizÔºå I said Wednesday here didn't like wow„ÄÇ

 do Thursday„ÄÇI hope the date is right ThursdayÔºå6 October„ÄÇ

Whatever it's in the schedule on the website and also want to point out that I did post lab one„ÄÇ

 we got the encryption worked out or actually the lack of encryption worked out so that you should be able to watch the traffic to and from the website properly now without any HCtTPS redirects and stuff like that so please go handle„ÄÇ

 go get working on that lab„ÄÇI left the quiz details this is actually not accurate I've not finished writing the quiz for this year„ÄÇ

 these are the numbers from last year for this quiz and„ÄÇI wrote that quizÔºå I'm going to write this„ÄÇ

From a multiple answer„ÄÇ And then there were fair number of„ÄÇShort answer right„ÄÇ

 an answer requiring a couple words to maybe a sentence or cell„ÄÇ

 and those are often you know described this concept sort of thing„ÄÇ

 what's the difference between this concept and that conceptÔºüI would like to point outÔºå and in fact„ÄÇ

 on the quizÔºå I specify a word lengthÔºå okayÔºå when we did quizzes on paper„ÄÇ

 I would give you some space and say you can't write anything out of here„ÄÇ

What I'm trying to do is make it easy for you okay I don't want when I ask a question about X„ÄÇ

 I don't want you to tell me everything you know about X„ÄÇüò°ÔºåOkay„ÄÇ

 I want you to answer the question I asked„ÄÇAnd if you tell me everything about X„ÄÇ

 then that's an indication to me that you don't know the answer and you're just kind of spewing as much stuff as you can„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so„ÄÇWowÔºå okayÔºå what happened there„ÄÇ„ÅìÂÆ∂„Å†„Çç„ÄÇOkayÔºå' see I see it„ÄÇ I'm presuming Zoom still sees it„ÄÇ

 is that true„ÄÇOkayÔºå somebody's having fun with her„ÄÇü§ßWith their big screenÔºå I guessÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So the point there is you will see limits that say oh„ÄÇ

 we're only going to grade the first 30 words of your answer„ÄÇ

 what I'm trying to do is tell you just write a sentence there okay in those cases what I've done is I've taken my answer and I've doubled it and then rounded is somewhere near so if it took me eight words to answer the question and the answer key„ÄÇ

 I'm going to say your answer should be 15 words or less„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 because I don't want you to tell me everything you know about X„ÄÇJust answer the question„ÄÇ

 same with medium answersÔºå and we did have one Q and theory question last time„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so what are we going to talk about todayÔºå we're going to talk about this idea of queuing theory and we're going to see some ways two main ways that it gets applied to some of the systems we have„ÄÇ

Nowqueuing theory itselfÔºå the optional readings are notÔºå noÔºå they're optional right„ÄÇ

 so it wouldn't be fair for me to assume that everybody had read it„ÄÇÂØπ„ÄÇü§ßAll right„ÄÇ

 so queuing theory is this tool that's come up that was developed„ÄÇ

Out of a lot of operations research conceptsÔºå building industrial systems and figuring out how to make those work and how to manage businesses at scale„ÄÇ

 and it turns out it's exactly the right math for networks as well because what those systems have and have been able to abstract about behavior we also have in terms of packets showing up at routers and things like that„ÄÇ

Soqueuing theory is all about a process where there's some queuing what that means is you have some use the queuing theory terminology occasionally I'll dive into you'll find me using networking terminology„ÄÇ

 but what you have is you have some customers showing up somewhere at some service facility that has a limited capability to service those customers„ÄÇ

And so the customersÔºå when they show up„ÄÇOnly a certain number of them can actually go into the service facility if there's somebody already in the service facility„ÄÇ

 then that customer has to wait and when they wait they get in a line and that is a queue„ÄÇ

 so that's where the queuing theory term comes from„ÄÇ

And so then those customers will arrive will go into the queue after some amount of time of waiting„ÄÇ

 they will go into the service facilityÔºå get serviced and then they're doneÔºå they leave„ÄÇOkayÔºå and„ÄÇ

You know some of the customers in real life can you be discouraged and leave and there's some other kind of paths through this„ÄÇ

 but in general we have some items showing up„ÄÇGetting processed in in turn by some facility that has a certain capability and then leaving okay and„ÄÇ

You probably can see this description and automatically think like oh that's the grocery store right I'm standing in line waiting for the cashier at the grocery store or the teller at the bank or the barber„ÄÇ

 you know there's lots of places in your life where you run into these queuing theory streams where this math all works„ÄÇ

But technically the math was developed know to help out like steel mills figure out how much steel should show up so the customers don't have to be people it could be you know tons of coal coming into one end of the factory and the factory has a certain capability that's the service facility you know and we want to know how much steel can go out and we want to know how big the pile of coal can be or should be outside of the factory for us doing networking this is often packets showing up at a router okay they show up the router has a certain capability to manage them and then they leave„ÄÇ

And we can do this math to figure outÔºå OhÔºå how big should that Q be„ÄÇ

 How many packets should I be able to handle„ÄÇHow much memory will my router needÔºü

The queuing system itselfÔºå we found kind of six characteristics that we have to think about when we're looking at these systems„ÄÇ

 and so we'll look at these six things in general„ÄÇThe first is the arrival pattern„ÄÇ

How is it that our customers show up and well it turns out the interesting part about this and the reason we need this math is because customers show up whenever customers want to show up packets come to routers„ÄÇ

 whenever packets want well we're anthropomorphizing the packets„ÄÇ

 whenever the users want to send packets to a router„ÄÇ

There's no schedule or pattern or something like that it's just kind of like oh randomly they're going to show up so we say that they're stochastic„ÄÇ

And we can't tell you exactly when a particular customer is going to show up„ÄÇ

But we can describe the probability density functionÔºå that's what I mean by PDFÔºå not the file format„ÄÇ

The probability density functionÔºå So ohÔºå that's probably a word you haven't heard since your probability class right you may have gone through some therapy to try to forget that„ÄÇ

YeahÔºå we have some way of describing the distribution and saying„ÄÇ

 I don't know that you X customer will show up at Y time„ÄÇBut I do know that on averageÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 some number are going to show up„ÄÇ and I can usually measure that„ÄÇ

 It's one of the nice things about this pattern is you can station somebody with a stopwatch outside of the grocery store„ÄÇ

 knowÔºå that guy with the clipboard there„ÄÇ's he's counting how many customers are showing up in what amount of time„ÄÇ

And he's not sayingÔºå you knowÔºå customers showed up at exactlyÔºå you knowÔºå SevenÔºå47 AM„ÄÇ

 He's saying thatÔºå ohÔºå you knowÔºå over this 30 minute period that I measuredÔºå we hadÔºå57 customers„ÄÇ

 and that's this kind of average„ÄÇOkayÔºå so this is something we can measure„ÄÇ

Sometimes the customers show up in a bulk right occasionally the 61C drives up right in front of the right aid and all of a sudden you have a bunch more customers showing up and if that's something you worry about turns out queuing theory can specify that„ÄÇ

 but then you need to be able to know on average what's the bulk size like and how often do those bulks show up„ÄÇ

We say that the arrival pattern is stationary if it doesn't change with time now from a philosophical perspective„ÄÇ

 every arrival pattern changes with time„ÄÇBefore that steel factory was there„ÄÇ

 the arrival pattern was very different than after the steel factory was there„ÄÇ

RightAnd so over extremely long periods of timeÔºå nothing is purely stationary„ÄÇ

 but we say a pattern is stationary if you know we're not going to worry about those startup and end times we're going to say oh„ÄÇ

 like in the middle of the dayÔºå this is what we care aboutÔºå this is what the pattern looks like„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 ifÔºå you knowÔºå once my network is up and runningÔºå this is what these patterns look likeÔºå not a„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå we„ÄÇFrom the time before the company existed sort of patternsÔºå right„ÄÇYeahÔºå no pattern is„ÄÇ

Is actually truly stationaryÔºå but most of them are mostly stationary„ÄÇ

 and it helps us make a lot of simplifications in the math„ÄÇ

 and that actually leads to answers that aren't too far off what they would be if we„ÄÇ

Didude more complicated math about that„ÄÇNowqueuing theory also manages to think about customer behavior that's not normal„ÄÇ

 oftentimesÔºå well it depends on the system we're dealing with in our networks„ÄÇ

 we don't have customers with will of their own„ÄÇAnd so some of this doesn't apply to networking„ÄÇ

 but in queuing theoryÔºå we have customersÔºå I'm sure you're like thisÔºå rightÔºü

You sometimes show up at the barbershop„ÄÇAnd you're likeÔºå ohÔºå there's already 27 people in here„ÄÇ

 that's going to be a long wait for meÔºå I'm just going to close the door and walk away and go get coffee instead right we say that you have balked when that happens„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇWe also have a reneging process is where okayÔºå you've gone into the barbershop„ÄÇ

 you've sat there for 20 minutesÔºå you've noticed that the line hasn't really moved and you've decided that you know Joeill Lasso is on and you've got to leave right now and so you've been there for a while„ÄÇ

 but you've then depart„ÄÇAnd I don't know how many of you do this„ÄÇ

 I do it all the time right I jockey for a positionÔºå you go to the grocery store„ÄÇ

 I don't know about you guys I shop a lot with my wifeÔºå right we always get in different lines„ÄÇ

And then we stand in those lines for a while until we get closer and we're likeÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 she's beating meÔºå let me go change and be in her line or something like that that sort of behavior„ÄÇ

we don't see that one too much in networkingÔºå I should point out that some of these we do see right depends on what you're measuring if you're looking at what's going on with a firewall„ÄÇ

 for instance„ÄÇYou can model some of that behavior of individual packets coming in as oh„ÄÇ

 the firewall threw this one away and so that means it entered my system„ÄÇ

But it never made it to the router in the back and so it's kind of like it stood in line of while and then reneged sort of behavior„ÄÇ

The second characteristic to talk about is the service pattern Okay so now we know what the customers are doing„ÄÇ

 what's the facility doingÔºå what is our router capable of doing Okay and again this tends to be stochastic„ÄÇ

Some packets we're able to work hard onÔºå some we aren't„ÄÇ

 some require more garbage collection and memory management than others„ÄÇ

Some require more work or less work„ÄÇAnd so therefore„ÄÇ

 I can't say this is the number of CPU cycles my router is going to spend„ÄÇBut I can say on average„ÄÇ

 this is what's going to happen„ÄÇAnd this again is generally an easy thing to measure right we get somebody with a stopwatch who's actually looking now not at the customers coming into the barber shop but the actual barbers right and measuring oh you know that haircut took eight minutes and this one took 12 minutes and then you know over the day coming up with some sort of average for that and so again we'll be talking about probability distribution functions„ÄÇ

Not peer schedules„ÄÇSometimes the service patternÔºå we said state dependent„ÄÇ

Okay that means that the state of the system for a queuing system is considered to be the number of customers that are there„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so if a service pattern is state dependentÔºå that means the actual number depends on how many customers there are„ÄÇ

And so you see this occasionally with„ÄÇYou knowThe new trainee at the you know who gets really flustered when there's lots of people watching and waiting right or other sorts of behaviors where maybe you know maybe a server would say„ÄÇ

 oh you know look I see there's a lot of customers waiting and line out in the foer at my restaurant so let me move let me get these tables bust really quickly so that we can move more people in here and they're reacting to the number of people that are there and so those are state dependent servers„ÄÇ

UsuallyÔºå our service„ÄÇProbability distribution functions are state independent„ÄÇ

 does it matter how many people are there„ÄÇü§ßServices can also be stationary or nons stationary„ÄÇ

 remember this was the whether they changed through time„ÄÇ

Where the patterns depend on what time of day it is„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇThe queuing discipline itself„ÄÇ

 we're used to going and seeing a line and you stand at the back of the line and you exit the queue from the front of the line„ÄÇ

 that's a first inÔºå first out line„ÄÇBut those aren't always what we see sometimes you have last come first serve„ÄÇ

We know this in computer systems as a stack„ÄÇWhere the last thing to show up is the first thing that we're actually going to service„ÄÇ

 those sometimes are useful in inventory control or other sorts of places„ÄÇ

Maybe you randomly choose something like that and there of course are different priority schemes„ÄÇ

 we will actually talk about priority routing in a future lecture where some packets like oh„ÄÇ

 you know this is the data that the general has it should go first over top of those corporals sort of system„ÄÇ

There may or may not be physical limitations to the cues„ÄÇThere's alwaysÔºå in real life„ÄÇ

 fiscal limitations to the cues„ÄÇOkayÔºå but„ÄÇImpmosing those changes the math and makes some of the analysis more difficult„ÄÇ

 and so oftentimes we will ignore that„ÄÇAllÔºå we'll sayÔºå ohÔºå I'm not going to worry about it too much„ÄÇ

 okayÔºüBut in other casesÔºå we do need to make sure we understand this„ÄÇ

 and so maybe we're worried about how much buffer system capacity there is„ÄÇRightÔºå this is„ÄÇYou know„ÄÇ

 how big can the queue get„ÄÇSo in my router there technically is right in fact that may be what I'm doing the analysis to figure out will it be okay if I have X amount of memory to store the waitinging packets or notÔºü

Okay againÔºå this is one that's oftentimes ignored because the math gets more complicated and sometimes it matters and sometimes it doesn't so as aqueuing theorist you you would have to know when to do the math and when not to„ÄÇ

P„ÄÇIt's possible that having multiple service channels is a good idea„ÄÇ

 And so this is all gets around the idea of whether„ÄÇ

I like to think about it as are you in a grocery store or are you in a bank right there are different kind of models for how you get to the service channels you have so„ÄÇ

Here I have instead of having a single teller and you know all the people at the bank in that line are serviced by that single teller„ÄÇ

 maybe I have multiple tellers at the bankÔºå of course you get in one line and then when you get to the front of the line you go to whichever teller is open„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that's kind of„ÄÇIn factÔºå we're going to see this more and more in computing systems because this is typically what happens I got multiple cores in my router„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå I'm just going to have a list of incoming routes and you know when you get to the front„ÄÇ

 get you get handled„ÄÇBut there may be some capacity in terms of the service„ÄÇ



![](img/3220a1b5073eff146c3390c57709d6f4_6.png)

More complicated systems also will have multiple stages of service„ÄÇ

So what that means is you have a queue and a service facility„ÄÇ

 but that's not the only thing you're analyzingÔºå you're analyzing some other Q and service facility in combination with this„ÄÇ

So we may see it in our network systems because packets come into the data center right and then they go through a firewall„ÄÇ

 which is a queue and a service facility and then they get passed over to a load balancer„ÄÇ

 which is a queue and a service facility and then they get to a web server and then there's a back in database as well or whatever right and analyzing each of them individually isn't really what I care about what I care about is the service that the whole data center is providing„ÄÇ

so that becomes a multistage system my example here is one I think I was annoyed with the doctor's office when I was writing these slides because you go to the doctor's office„ÄÇ

 you sit in the waiting room and then the receptionist saysÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 please come up and you fill out this clipboard worth of information and then go sit in the waiting room again and then the nurse comes out and she you know asks to take your blood pressure and then you go sit in the waiting room again okay and that becomes a multist queuing system eventually you get to wait for the doctor to show up and then the doctor service is you„ÄÇ

So these six characteristics were early on recognized to be important„ÄÇ

Because how they are how each of them is chosen„ÄÇAnd how the system is being built that will use each of those these different characteristics means that the math is slightly different„ÄÇ

And I like to think about this in the queuing theory textbook form„ÄÇ

RightWhat we're doing today is basically chapter one of aqueuing theory textbook chapter two picks up particular situations„ÄÇ

 saysÔºå ohÔºå what happens if we have you know different kinds of arrival patterns„ÄÇ

 what happens if you know if we've got random in one way versus another and chapter three is a different type of arrival pattern and chapter four is a different and each one of them comes up with some equations that are useful okay„ÄÇ

Nott organized that back in 1953„ÄÇGu named Kendall came up with a notation„ÄÇ

 a way to be able to specify„ÄÇBecause at that point„ÄÇ

queuing theory was getting big and unwieldy and there were bunches of equations„ÄÇ

But you had to know which situations the equations were appropriate for„ÄÇOkayAnd he saidÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 we've got these characteristics„ÄÇ Let's put them together in a niceÔºå easy to specify form„ÄÇ

And we're going to just call it with an AÔºå then a slashÔºå then a BÔºå then a slash„ÄÇThen an x„ÄÇ

 and sometimes a slash Y and even less frequently a slash is Z„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

This notation specifies that that first positionÔºå the A position in this notation tells you about the arrival of the customers„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå what's that Pdf like„ÄÇOkayÔºå is it WellÔºå there's some choices if it's„ÄÇExponential or Markovviian„ÄÇ

 That's where the M comes from„ÄÇWe sayÔºå ohÔºå this is a Markov process„ÄÇ

And with exponential distributed in arrival timesÔºå that's an M„ÄÇOkayÔºå but if it's a different one„ÄÇ

 if it's deterministicÔºå if you know that a customer is showing up every 10 secondsÔºå exactly„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 then you'd write a D there or and there are other choices„ÄÇ

And then you already slash and then you sayÔºå okayÔºå how about the service facilityÔºå how do they work„ÄÇ

 What's their PDF look like I it exponentialÔºå is it deterministic„ÄÇAnd same sort of thing„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and then you have a slash„ÄÇThe X is for the number of servers you have„ÄÇ

How many of these service facilities do you have that are working in parallelÔºå You have one„ÄÇ

 you have two„ÄÇDo you have an incident numberÔºå turns out there's math for that too„ÄÇ

Oftentimes you stop thereÔºå okayÔºå so it's very common to have M slash M slash1Ôºå for instance„ÄÇTo say„ÄÇ

 oh this you know the customers coming in and the service„ÄÇ

 both of them have no memory and they're not state dependent and so they're Mark Coby and and so we specify them that way„ÄÇ

 but occasionally then I want to go on and add on a max capacity how big is my cue„ÄÇ

 how many customers can fit or how many packets can fit into that memory„ÄÇ

 or maybe I want to change the queing disciplineÔºå maybe instead of first and first out it's last in first out or random or something like that„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and so what we end up with are„ÄÇThese kindled notations for differentqueuing systems„ÄÇAnd really„ÄÇ

 what we're doing is we're„ÄÇGoing to associate different mathematical equations and analysis techniques for each of these„ÄÇ

OkaySo that's really what's important is you want to know which chapter of the textbook to open up to„ÄÇ

OkayÔºåAnd so for instanceÔºå ohÔºå Gs are complicated„ÄÇOkayG means I don't know„ÄÇ

 I have made no assumptions about how the customers show up or how the service is handled„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 it's not that in real lifeÔºå we look at something and we sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 this system is operating under a general„ÄÇPrinciippleÔºå okay„ÄÇInstead„ÄÇ

 it deals with the equations we're able to use if I've made no assumptions about how customers show up or how many servers I have or anything like that„ÄÇ

 then I can sayÔºå ohÔºå this is a general system„ÄÇSo I have G G1„ÄÇ

 we're actually going to develop some of these equations very shortly„ÄÇ

 A G G1 system doesn't make assumptions„ÄÇAbout how customers show up or how service is done„ÄÇ

 it does specify that there's a single server„ÄÇAnd that means that any equation we come up with as we derive that is applicable in general„ÄÇ

 can be used on any queuing system that only has one serverÔºå or GGCÔºå I would be able to specify„ÄÇ

 I've done the math and the equations have a C in it and so if I have 57 servers„ÄÇ

 I just plug the number 57 in wherever the C is„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

Ms would be Marovian in those cases I've made an assumption„ÄÇ

 okay I'm using something about the math that means that this applies only in situations where customers show up with exponentially distributed inter arrival times„ÄÇ

So it makes senseÔºå and that basically tells youÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 which chapter of the textbook do I go to to get the equations and the techniques to help me analyze this sort of system„ÄÇ

And given a particular systemÔºå you can open up to the MMmÔºå you knowÔºå or whatever M„ÄÇ

 then Erlang slash slash C system and use that mathÔºå or you can use all the math that's in the GGC„ÄÇ

ChapterÔºå because your system also those equations apply as wellÔºå so makes sense„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so that's kind of where we're going with queing theoryÔºå let's actually dig in and see some of it„ÄÇ

First thing we'd want to do is we'd want to analyze some performance„ÄÇ

 actually it's mostly what we want to do hereÔºå so we're going to start working some math and so that means we need to have some variables to deal with some parameters and so let's pull out some Greek letters„ÄÇ

Quuing theory uses Lambda as the symbol for the average arrival rate for the customers„ÄÇAnd so again„ÄÇ

 this is an easily measurable parameterÔºå you have a stopwatch somewhere you you're looking at the customers showing up this is on average„ÄÇ

 remember the customers show up as they like sarcastically„ÄÇ

This is the number of customers or packets you're going to have coming into the system per second„ÄÇ

So that's dealing with the input of the customers mu is dealing with how fast we can handle these„ÄÇ

 what's the service rate look like okay on average„ÄÇ

 how many packets per second is my CPU capable of handlingÔºüOkayÔºåAnd so that that again„ÄÇ

 a measurable techniqueÔºå let's get out the stopwatches„ÄÇAnd figure out what that number is„ÄÇ

 on average„ÄÇOr maybe what the probability distribution function looks like„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇBut thenÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 that's mut„ÄÇC is the number of servers that again fairly standardÔºå right should be easily measurable„ÄÇ

 you built the systemÔºå you should know how many parallel tracks there are that can handle customers at the same time„ÄÇ

All right so given those parameters and we will get moreÔºå don't worry„ÄÇ

 our first equation is this one we're going to define a thing called traffic intensity I give you a little taste of this a couple lectures ago or pointed out that this number we don't want to get it too close to one this talks about the ratio between incoming work and outgoing work„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so we're going to take the LambdaÔºå which is the number of customers arriving per second„ÄÇ

And we're going to divide that by muÔºå which is the number of customers that can be serviced per second„ÄÇ

 But thats mu is a number that's based upon each server„ÄÇ And so if I have more servers„ÄÇ

 I can do more work„ÄÇ And so„ÄÇI get lambda over„ÄÇ ohÔºå turns out this is my favorite equation in the world„ÄÇ

 I think„ÄÇOkayÔºå why„ÄÇThe traffic intensity is Lambda„ÄÇOvers mu„ÄÇYeahÔºå that's right„ÄÇ

 we have our ownqueuing theory equationÔºå MIT doesn't have an equation like this„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 Lambda over see you„ÄÇIs the traffic intensityÔºå also known as rubÔºü

This number is unitless and it's just this ratioÔºå how much work coming in versus work going out„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 I also like that„ÄÇ C mu„ÄÇIs like how much work can be doneÔºå rightÔºå Our heart really is in the work„ÄÇ

When row is greater than oneÔºå when the traffic intensity is greater than one„ÄÇ

 that means you've got more work„ÄÇComing inÔºå then you're able to do„ÄÇOkayÔºå and that's bad„ÄÇ

It's going to stack upÔºå I know this it feels like that the 12th week of a semester more work coming in than leaving and you don't want your system to do that„ÄÇ

 you want to do something to manage that system so that you can actually accomplish the work„ÄÇ

Turns out when Roe is oneÔºå you're still in trouble„ÄÇremember„ÄÇ

 these are random distributions of stuff and„ÄÇIf the input can be random„ÄÇ

 sometimes you're not going to have any customers showing up at all„ÄÇ

 and then if if it's perfectly balanced with the amount of work you can doÔºå that means that„ÄÇ

You that no work to do is going to at some point mean that there's more work than you can handle and that effectively builds up and means that your cues get full and never actually are able to it feels like you should be able to handle that but you can't what you want is a row less than one and usually we want it„ÄÇ

You'd like it far less than oneÔºå although that means you're„ÄÇ

You're spending more for equipment than you necessarily need„ÄÇAll rightÔºå more„ÄÇMore equations N„ÄÇ

Is the number of customers that you have at a particular time„ÄÇ

 so I'm showing that is n with T as an input to that function„ÄÇOkayÔºå this is„ÄÇ

this is something that's hard to measureÔºå it's hard to figure out what that actual function is for the number of customers you would have at any point in time„ÄÇ

There is an n sub queue to tell you how many customers are in the queue and an Ns of S for how many are being serviced at any point in time„ÄÇ

It's basically our system has a queueÔºå has place for people to wait and it has a place for customers to be serviced„ÄÇ

 and so we like to know what those numbers are and the total number is going to be the sum of NQ and S„ÄÇ

Now what we can more likely measure is not what the actual function is„ÄÇ

 but what the characteristics that function areÔºå so what's the average„ÄÇ

 what's the expected number that you're going to have in the system at any point in time„ÄÇ

 so what's expected value of n„ÄÇOkayÔºå we're going to call that L„ÄÇ

And I'm going to do this several times today I apologize they didn't ask me when they came up with these terms okay L doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense for me for the average number of customers in the system but that's what's used that's expected value of the number that are in the system„ÄÇ

 how do you figure out the expected value or the average„ÄÇ

 how do you average all these oh that's easy we know how to do that from our probability class what we do is we count well how many customers are there times the probability of that situation happening„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so P sub n is going to be the probability that I have n customers right„ÄÇ

 So P sub5 is the probability that I have five customers„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to take that piece of five and I'm going to multiply it by five„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and I'm going to add that to the probability of six customers times six and probability of seven„ÄÇ

 times sevenÔºå et ceteraÔºå right that's pretty much the definition of expected value when I add that from zero to infinity„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇI can also do that for the number that are in the Q„ÄÇ

 this one makes a little bit more sense to meÔºå I like L here„ÄÇ

 the length of the Q sort of makes sense there and maybe that's where it started and so L has to be for the entire the length of the system feels a little weird„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so now we're trying to figure out what the expected value is for the number that are in the queue„ÄÇ

And the equation gets a little bit more complicated„ÄÇWell„ÄÇ

 if I have some number of customers in the system„ÄÇWhat that means is I'm going to have as many in service as possible„ÄÇ

 and then the leftovers are in the queue„ÄÇSo if I have a system with C servers„ÄÇ

Imagine I have 10 servers„ÄÇThen if I have eight customers in the system„ÄÇ

 I will have zero in the queue right because those eight will be being handled by the servers„ÄÇ

And so that's why I have to take the number in the system and subtract out the number of servers actually have and minus C„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and then that's the value that I'm going to multiply by the probability of there being that many customers in the system„ÄÇ

 SoÔºå you knowÔºå if I have a 10 server system„ÄÇThen I only want to then I don't worry about the situation where I have less than 10 customers because all those will be in service„ÄÇ

 none will be in the queue„ÄÇAnd so I'm going to add up from C plus one„ÄÇFrom 10 plus oneÔºå what happens„ÄÇ

 five 11 customersÔºå OkayÔºå well 5Ôºå11 customersÔºå then I'm going to add up 11 minus 10„ÄÇ

 I'm going to say there's one in the Q times the probability therere being 11 customers„ÄÇ

And just keep doing that up to infinity„ÄÇMakes sense„ÄÇSo I told you this map wasn't too hard„ÄÇThis„ÄÇ

 by the wayÔºå makes us think a little bit about what's happening to the customers showing up and how to measure this and so„ÄÇ

Remember a guy with a stopwatch who's measuring these customers coming in„ÄÇ

 what he's doing is he's measuring the inter arrival time„ÄÇ

He's saying this packet showed up at time X and the next packet showed up at x plus some amount„ÄÇ

 that amount is the enter arrival timeÔºå the amount of time between the arrivals of each of my customers or packets or whatever„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and so you can draw like this time arrow of what's happening when right when customer end shows up„ÄÇ

WellÔºå that customer is going to have to wait in the queue until the customer before him departs„ÄÇ

 this is kind of assuming a one service system„ÄÇRight and so you're going to be in the Q for T subq amount of time that's and the N there says this is the arrival time or inter time the time between that we're in the queue right and then you're going to go into service„ÄÇ

For some amount of time SÔºå that's the service time„ÄÇOkayÔºå and„ÄÇAnd then you're going to depart„ÄÇ

So when the customer before you has leftÔºå then you go into service and after X amount of time you're gone„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå this tells us that the total amount of time we're spent in the system„ÄÇ

Is equal to total the amount of time you're in the queue plus your service time again I got to apologize I probably would have made that T of s okay but this is what we've got s is the service time„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that equation should be really obvious apart from knowing which variable means whatÔºüAll right„ÄÇ

 along comes our first really substantial resultÔºå okay little's law named after a queuing theorist named little is a way is a is an equation that lets us specify a relationship between the number of customers you have and the time they have to wait„ÄÇ

ËØ•„ÄÇSome of this feels intuitive to us„ÄÇOkayÔºå that if there are lots of customers„ÄÇ

 you're going to have to wait longer„ÄÇBasically„ÄÇAnd little was able to specify this in this famous law„ÄÇ

Not easy to prove„ÄÇOkayÔºå but he's the guy that managed to prove that this is going to happen„ÄÇ

 even though it's very intuitive to us„ÄÇAll rightÔºå so what did we got now we're worried about time„ÄÇ

So previously we had TsÔºå inter arrival timesÔºå time in queueÔºå S is the service time„ÄÇ

I would like to go ahead and find some expected values for those I'd like to know what the average times are and so we're going to pull out W another letter of the alphabet to specify the average waiting time that you're going to be in the queue that's the expected value of the time in the queue„ÄÇ

The W without the Q is the average time here in the system as a whole„ÄÇ

 that's expected value of T so T and TQ are these ones we got on the previous page„ÄÇRightÂóØ„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇ

By the wayÔºå you might immediately sayÔºå wait a minuteÔºå that's my T and my TQÔºå what happened to S„ÄÇ

what's that one there and it turns out the expected value vast we've already dealt with„ÄÇ

 we already have something for that„ÄÇThe expected time that you're going to spend in service is actually the inverse of the service rate„ÄÇ

Make sense„ÄÇThe time you spend the servicesÔºå how many customers per secondÔºüGet serviced„ÄÇ

The expected value of the time that you would spend would be the inverse of that how many seconds per customer basically okay and we have mu„ÄÇ

 which was the parameter from a couple slide before that told us the service rate so one over mu is the average waiting service time„ÄÇ

Exspeced value of S and so littles slot„ÄÇIs this relationshipÔºå it saysÔºå ohÔºå look„ÄÇLÔºå what was L„ÄÇ

 L was the number of the average number of customers in the system„ÄÇ

He says that's equal to the arrival rate„ÄÇLambda„ÄÇHow fast are the customer showing up„ÄÇTimes W„ÄÇ

 this expected valueÔºå this average waiting time in the system„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

And so that that's that intuitive feeling we haveÔºå rightÔºå if you have more customers showing up„ÄÇ

And they each spend a long time in the system„ÄÇ That means the queue is going to be long„ÄÇ

 You're going to have a lot of waiting rightÔºå That means the number in the system is going to be long„ÄÇ

You can do thisÔºå by the wayÔºå you can apply little's law just to the queue if you want„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 to say the numberÔºå the length of the Q is equal to lambda times the amount of time you wait in the Q as well„ÄÇ

NowÔºå the cool thing about this equation is you can then take it and apply it to„ÄÇ

The expected value T equal the expected value t subq plus expected value S„ÄÇ

 where does that come fromÔºå well that was previous page right t equals Tq plus S„ÄÇ

 I just took the expected value of the entire thing„ÄÇAnd then fill in the pieces right„ÄÇ

 expected value of T is actually w expected value of Tq is actually w is sub Q and the expected value of s as I mentioned a minute ago is the inverse of mu„ÄÇ

Now that equation and Little's law means that if you know Lambda and muÔºå mu shows up in there„ÄÇ

 Lambda in Little's lawÔºå if you know both of those numbersÔºå both of which are easy to measure„ÄÇ

 and so you're probably going to know those numbers„ÄÇAnd then you know one of thoseÔºå right„ÄÇ

 if you know the number on averageÔºå how many customers are in the system or how long they spend in the system„ÄÇ

 it turns out you can do the math to get all the others„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so this is a way of fairly quickly getting overall parameters for how long people are waiting„ÄÇ

How long packets are waitingÔºå how many packets I'm going to have in my queueÔºå those sorts of things„ÄÇ

All right„ÄÇExpected value of the number in service„ÄÇOkayÔºå well„ÄÇIf you're in service„ÄÇ

 so the number in serviceÔºå number of customers in service is equal to the number that are in the system minus the number that are in the queue„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇNow you may be looking there sayingÔºå wait a minute„ÄÇ

 if I have a server wouldn't expected value of the number of customers in service be oneÔºå no„ÄÇ

 not always because you may have times where you have no customers in the system and therefore nobody's being serviced„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇOr if you have multiple serversÔºå it may be that not all of the servers are being used because you don't I have 10 servers„ÄÇ

 but only eight customers„ÄÇThat means on averageÔºå the number in service is not going to be 10 all the time„ÄÇ

Okay I can use the little slÔºå rightÔºå L equals lambda W rightÔºå L Q equals lambda W Q„ÄÇ

Waiting time minus waiting in the Q is equal to service timeÔºå which is„ÄÇOne over mu„ÄÇ

 one over the service rate„ÄÇSo we're going to define R as being this lambda over mu value because it shows up all over the place„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and that is the expected number„ÄÇOf customers that are being serviced at any point in time„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå so if I take this understanding and want to do a little bit more math„ÄÇ

I'm going to make an assumption hereÔºå rightÔºå I'm going to say what happens when I have a single serverÔºü

I notice I just made an assumptionÔºå therefore„ÄÇThe equations that follow only apply„ÄÇ

To G slash G slash1 systems„ÄÇLittle's lawÔºå I didn't make any such assumptionsÔºå right„ÄÇ

 so it applies to all systems„ÄÇRight„ÄÇOkayÔºå so this one now G slash G slash1„ÄÇIn that situation„ÄÇ

 I can look and sayÔºå ohÔºå the average number of in that case„ÄÇ

 I know that the expected value of number and service is equal to this row„ÄÇ

 this traffic intensity value we used earlierÔºå right because R is1 over mu„ÄÇ

 remember rh was1 over C muÔºå if C is1Ôºå they're the same„ÄÇ

So now with my expected value for number and serviceÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 that's the link the number total minus the number in the Q right„ÄÇ

 The number total is on average once againÔºå I'm doing the„ÄÇThe expected value formula„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 what's n times the probability of N„ÄÇ I'm actually going to do that from 0 to infinity„ÄÇ

And then I'm showing it here from one to infinityÔºå because it turns outÔºå well„ÄÇ

 I'm going to need it in a minute„ÄÇBut it turns out the zero term is always zero„ÄÇ

Because how do I average that outÔºå I average it out as zero times the probability they're being zero Okay„ÄÇ

 so that term ends up being zero so I can just count from one to infinity„ÄÇAnd then since I have one„ÄÇ

System one serverÔºå the numbers in the queue is a probability ofÔºå well„ÄÇ

 this is the same equation we saw a minute ago that you all agreed to„ÄÇ

Here with n minus C in this situationÔºå C is1„ÄÇRightÔºå so n minus1 times„ÄÇProbability of n„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and in this caseÔºå the the probably n times pnsÔºå you can factor out of the second equation and you just end up with„ÄÇ

Adding up the probabilities„ÄÇFrom one to infinity of there being that number of customers„ÄÇ

 So what's a probability that there's one customer plus the probability there's two customers„ÄÇ

 plus the probabilityÔºå there's three customers„ÄÇThat should make perfect sense to usÔºå right„ÄÇ

 What's the probability or what's the average we're going to of there being effectively more than one customer or one or more customers in the system„ÄÇ

Because single server system one of them would be in the server that's happening and so I end up with one minus the probability of zero of there being zero customers„ÄÇ

Because all my probabilities have to add up the one„ÄÇProfessor„ÄÇ

 could you please explain how What else can I doÔºå Let's say that„ÄÇ I have„ÄÇA bunch of servers„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I have g slash g slash C„ÄÇ I'm not going to know what my lambdas and my muse look like and things like that„ÄÇ

 I'm just going to say„ÄÇI have multiple systemsÔºå I want to know the probability that any particular server is busy okay so this told me on average„ÄÇ

 how many customers are in the service bay in bottom one if there's only one server here I'm wanting to know„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå if I have multiple serversÔºå how often is each server busy and maybe that will tell me whether that server is overloaded or whether I've bought too big a server„ÄÇ

 that kind of thingÔºå let me scale out those servers„ÄÇ

So at Fety State we know R is equal to the expected value of Ns since all my servers we assume are identical„ÄÇ

 the math gets a lot more difficult if you have„ÄÇFast serverÔºå slow server kind of situations„ÄÇ

 So so far they're all identical„ÄÇ So we just take the amount of work that's being done divided by C„ÄÇ

 and that's a probability that a particular server is busy„ÄÇOkayÔºå R is lambover mu„ÄÇ

Row is Landover CMUÔºå and so a little bit of manipulation lets you know that this probability is equal to your traffic intensity„ÄÇ

Whi kind of makes sense if you're really busy that busyness is spread over all your servers„ÄÇ

 so the probability that any server is busy is going to be pretty high„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 I don't have chat app„ÄÇ I could get chat up„ÄÇsrry„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇHow did we arrive at one minusÔºüP0 previous„ÄÇ

 so I'm assuming that's previous slide„ÄÇOne minus p0Ôºå so if you agree to the last step„ÄÇ

 if I'm adding up all the probability there being one customer plus the probability there being two customers plus probability of being three customers„ÄÇ

That's a situation where all the probabilities have to equal one right„ÄÇ

 I don't have any situation that is not one where I have some number of customers„ÄÇ

And so if I'm adding them all up from one to infinity„ÄÇ

That's equal to one minus the one that I didn't add inÔºå which is probability of being zero„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so maybe you would agree if I reformulated that last piece and said that sum of all the probabilities from one to infinity„ÄÇ

 plus the probabilitybabil is there're being zero„ÄÇThat should equal oneÔºå and then I just slid„ÄÇ

The probability of being zero to the other side„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so here's like the equation sheet that we've gotten so far okay we've got a bunch of equations starting with you know our M oversU„ÄÇ

 yayÔºå our great equationÔºå Littles lawÔºå a bunch of other equations we've gotten and then down at the bottom we have two equations that I'm pointing out are GG1 equations„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåBecause these I made an assumption onÔºå I saidÔºå what happens if there's a single serverÔºü

And so you cannot apply those if you have four servers„ÄÇOkayÔºå because that's a GG4 system„ÄÇ

all the others are completely generalÔºå you can apply them whether you have one server or four servers„ÄÇ

Ê≤°Êúâ„ÄÇAll rightÔºå next step up is to use another tool so that I can make my analysis a little bit more specific„ÄÇ

 we call this a rate transition diagram and it's a way of describing these systems which we call birth death processes„ÄÇ

These are Markov chains where you have„ÄÇOn and some stochastic process that is generating new customers and some„ÄÇ

Process that is removing customers and we're a little bit morbid to call that birth and death right it's not that we're taking customers out and shooting them we're actually servicing them and then they leave the system„ÄÇ

Markov chains are„ÄÇThese interesting„ÄÇAnalytic tools where you specify states of your system and for us„ÄÇ

 the states are the number of customers we have and then we„ÄÇ

Specify the transitions between these states„ÄÇAnd figure out what the rates are for us to be able to move from one state to another„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and soÔºå for instanceÔºå if I have a birthÔºå if I'm in some state and I have a birth„ÄÇ

 I would move to the next state state of having one more„ÄÇ So if I'm„ÄÇ

 if I have five customers and another customer shows upÔºå OkayÔºå we now have six customers„ÄÇ

 I've moved to a different state„ÄÇIf I have six customers and one of them leaves„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to move to state five„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo I'm going to be moving between states based on how many customers I have„ÄÇ

 and that's going to let me draw these rate transition diagrams„ÄÇ

They're basically a state diagram where it says zero oneÔºå twoÔºå threeÔºå four„ÄÇ

 that's how many customers I have„ÄÇAnd so if I have zero customers and a customer shows up„ÄÇ

 I'm going to move to state oneÔºå what's the rate at which a customer shows upÔºüThat's on the arrow„ÄÇ

 I specify lambmbda zeroÔºå that is the rate that if I have zero customersÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 kind of what's the probability that I'm going to have another customer show up„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so those are those are random variables or the rate of random variables is lambda zero„ÄÇ

 lambda1 lambda  twoÔºå those are arrival rates„ÄÇAnd the museÔºå mu1Ôºå mu2Ôºå mu3„ÄÇ

 those are the service rates„ÄÇAnd I specified them with sub„ÄÇÂëÉ„ÄÇ

Subscripts to them because they can be different values„ÄÇIn generalÔºå they could be different„ÄÇ

Right and so we want' to be able to analyze thoseÔºå but for our purposes„ÄÇ

 I think you mentioned before we're assuming a uniform arrival rate get there I'm going to write some equations that we call flow balance equations and the idea is this my system is in steady state„ÄÇ

Which means that the probability of being in any state doesn't change through time„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

We don't have a situation where we have„ÄÇClusteringÔºå and as we go more and more and more„ÄÇ

 we drive ourselves towards state 2Ôºå rightÔºå That would mean we after a while would always have two customers there„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå ours our stationary systems„ÄÇ So that means the probability of having two customers at the beginning is gonna to be the same as the probability of having two customers later on„ÄÇ

Okay so if it's in steady stateÔºå that means that the flow into and out of these states has to be equal„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå the probability of having two stays the same„ÄÇ

And that means that the arrivals into state2 happen as often as the departures from state to„ÄÇ

 what are those arrivals and departures well„ÄÇTo get into state 2„ÄÇActually„ÄÇ

 I wrote the equation with the departures firstÔºå didn't I the departures out of a particular state are well two different ways of departing right I can get another customer which would move me to another state right if I'm in state two and another customer arrives„ÄÇ

 I moved to state three„ÄÇOr I could move out of state2„ÄÇBy servicing the customer„ÄÇ

 and now I only have one in the system„ÄÇOkayÔºå so I end up with„ÄÇ

Lambda for a particular state plus mu for a particular state„ÄÇ Those are the arrows leaving a state„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå both of them have this particular state number subs on them„ÄÇ

That's going to be equal to the arrows coming into the statesÔºå the rate at whichÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 I was in state one and another customer showed up or I was in state three and we serviced one„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and so the arrow is coming inÔºå that's lambda from the state minus1„ÄÇAnd mu from the state plus one„ÄÇ

And then the Ps are the probability that I'm in any particular state right„ÄÇ

 the probability Im in state twoÔºå probability I'm in state one and„ÄÇAn arrival happens„ÄÇ

 a probability in state three and a service happens„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇUnfortunately„ÄÇ

 and this is a fairly nice equation to look at„ÄÇ But I do have this discontinuity„ÄÇ

 I have to worry about right State 0 is handled differently because it doesn't have a state -1„ÄÇ

 There's no chance for us to have negative customers in our system„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so we have to deal with that one as a separate situation now I'm going to rewrite these equations Okay„ÄÇ

 I'm going to write the bottom one in terms of p0Ôºå the probability of there being zero okay I'm going to write the top one in terms of n plus one„ÄÇ

ActuallyÔºå yeahÔºå and plus one„ÄÇOkayÔºå and so I'm just going to move some terms around„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇ

 we have a derivation Okay in generalÔºå I don't like teaching derivations I don't think you should memorize derivations I'm doing this though„ÄÇ

 just to kind of show you how you know this is what the textbook and queuing theory looks like as we come up with these different equations and it's not anything to be super scared of Okay„ÄÇ

 it's a little bit of math„ÄÇThere's a lot of creek numbers and subscripts that's the part that's maybe a little intimidating„ÄÇ

 but it will handle it„ÄÇThose first two equations up there„ÄÇ

 the probability of there're being n plus one and the probability that they're being one„ÄÇ

 those are rewrites of the equations on the previous page„ÄÇ

 all I've done is I've done algebra to get the PN plus1 and the P1 by themselves okay„ÄÇ

If I know what P1 is„ÄÇAnd I know an equation for n plus oneÔºå then I can calculate P2„ÄÇ

 the probability of being two customers in the systemÔºå rightÔºüSure„ÄÇ

 I just take P1 and I plug it into the top equation right And after a slight amount of algebra„ÄÇ

 I end up with this equation„ÄÇ P2 is equal to lambda1„ÄÇ

Times lambda zero divided by mu to mu1 times the probability of being zero customers in the system„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and I could do that againÔºå rightÔºå That's P2„ÄÇ it's P3„ÄÇ WellÔºå I take that equation„ÄÇ

 I plug it back into that top equation„ÄÇAnd after a little bit of work„ÄÇ

 I'm going to get lambda two times lamb to 1 times lambda to zero„ÄÇDivided by mu3Ôºå mu2 mu1„ÄÇ

 And so you're probably seeing a pattern here„ÄÇ This is inductive reasoning„ÄÇ We're going to sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 well that then„ÄÇknow let me go ahead and just extend that„ÄÇ

 that means that the probability of their being in„ÄÇ

 but we' know the probability of there being 147 customers in my system„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 I now I'm an equation for that„ÄÇ I would have lambda146 times lambda 140„ÄÇ5ive„ÄÇ

 all the way down to lambda0Ôºå divided by all the muse„ÄÇAnd so we express that just with this big pie„ÄÇ

 right the big pi is the same as the big sigmma except we're multiplying instead of adding„ÄÇ

A question about all this„ÄÇOkayÔºå it turns out we're going to then apply this idea and that equation to MM1 systems„ÄÇ

These are very common systems and even if they're not exactly your system„ÄÇ

 oftentimes from aqueuing theory perspectiveÔºå we sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 I could do the simple math and come up with an answer that's within a half a percent or I can do the hard math and make it happen exactly okay depends on who's paying and how they're paying as to which way you go on that one rightÔºü

So for a MM1 system„ÄÇThose are exponentially distributed„ÄÇ

 that means there's no the time at which a customer shows up is independent of the inter arrivalrial time of the customer before them„ÄÇ

So this means we're not all getting off the bus at the same time„ÄÇ

 it just means I randomly walked into the bank„ÄÇBecause I had a need to go into the bank„ÄÇ

 it didn't depend upon there being others who also had a need to go to the bank at that point in time and a lot of systems are like this„ÄÇ

Right„ÄÇThe way the reason the math is easier is because that means that all my Lambdas and all my mus are the same„ÄÇ

 so again I'm drawing my flow balance equations off of this Markov chain but you'll notice I have no subscripts anymore because it doesn't matter whether there are three or four or five customers in the system„ÄÇ

 the chance of there being a new customer shows up is independent of that„ÄÇ

That's what I'm looking for and that's oftentimes what we haveÔºå right you knowÔºüËøô‰∏Ä‰∏™„ÄÇ

I'm guessing this slide rightÔºüOf we get for P doesn't involve any„ÄÇOr used to like right„ÄÇ„Åó„Å¶„ÄÇ

That's correctÔºå well the one above„ÄÇRight to the left ofÔºå yeah„ÄÇ„ÅÑ„Åì„ÇÑ„ÄÇ

Because first I can seem like if you're in a state that right minuteÔºå you could end up in this data„ÄÇ

Do you think that eventually it would matter that at some point I had 57 customers in here to where he had doneÔºü

6 it would matter know„ÄÇThe ones above„ÄÇ What's my intuitive feel for thatÔºå I guess„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇ

 I don't have anyÔºå any real good and„ÄÇIntuition for that other than recognizing that all these probabilities are going to be linked up„ÄÇ

 they all got to add to one and so in some sense being able to chop out half of them and focus„ÄÇ

On on one section„ÄÇSince all of the add up to oneÔºå maybe I get to ignore the other part„ÄÇ

 that doesn't feel like a super intuitive and satisfying answer to me„ÄÇ

But it's the best I got at the moment„ÄÇOther than thatÔºå I'll just sayÔºå ohÔºå math„ÄÇ

Does a question about what mean this one„ÄÇU„ÄÇSo the assumptions are that this is a state diagram„ÄÇ

 rightÔºå and that it is this stationary system„ÄÇSo that the probabilities of being in one state don't change and in this case that the in arrival times are independent and so that that means all my rates of births and deaths„ÄÇ

Are all the same„ÄÇThat the averages are the same„ÄÇThey're not linked to each other„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so now I can do similar math„ÄÇOkayÔºå I could go through and write the equations„ÄÇ

I could go through and do this same inductive„ÄÇProof that or not quite proof Inductive derivation I did a minute ago„ÄÇ

 or I could just look at this and I sayÔºå ohÔºå this equation has lambdaÔºå you knowÔºå3Ôºå lambda 2„ÄÇ

 lambda 1Ôºå lambda 0Ôºå but all those are the same„ÄÇSo I don't need that anymore„ÄÇ

 instead it's lambda lambda lambda lambda divided by mu mu muum muu„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 it doesn't matter which one they are„ÄÇ And so that means now„ÄÇMy equation just got a lot simpler„ÄÇ

 right nowÔºå instead of having a product of a whole bunch of different lambdas and mus„ÄÇ

 I have a product of a whole bunch of the same lambda and mu„ÄÇ

Which means I can just take the same lambda Mm and raise it to the end power„ÄÇ

So that's going to simplify a bunch of stuff„ÄÇThis is kind of cool„ÄÇ

 this means if I want to know what the probability of there being 57 customers in my system„ÄÇ

 that equation tells me„ÄÇI pull out the stopwatchÔºå figure out what Lada isÔºå figure out what mu is„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå take lambda over muÔºå raise it to the what that say 57th powerÔºå okayÔºå and then„ÄÇÂì¶„ÄÇ

I actually have to multiply it by the probability of being zero customers in the system„ÄÇ

And I don't know that yet„ÄÇOkayÔºå and that's a harder thing to measure„ÄÇ

So instead we're going to pull out some analytics and some math and figure that out„ÄÇ

 what we're going to do is we're going to sayÔºå ohÔºå all these probabilities have to add to one„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå so I'm going to take from n to infinityÔºå all my probabilities add them together„ÄÇ

 and I have an equation now for what piece of n is„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to take that equation from the previous pageÔºå plug it in here„ÄÇ

So P sub n is p0 times lamb over mu raised theM power„ÄÇP0 is a constant„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so I get to pull that out of this sum now I just need to raise„ÄÇ

 I'm going to remember that lambda over mu is equal to row word're in an MM1 system so„ÄÇ

It's actually lambda over CMUÔºå but C is a1„ÄÇSo I'm going to just„ÄÇ

To help me keep the Greek letters downÔºå I'm going to make it row to the nth power„ÄÇ

And you might have seen this before„ÄÇ This is when you're adding up a bunch of„ÄÇVue the power„ÄÇ

 This is the typical you knowÔºå what is one half plus one quarter plus one8 plus 1Ôºå16th kind of thing„ÄÇ

 and as long as„ÄÇThat's a fractional value„ÄÇ It actually adds up to somethingÔºå right„ÄÇ

 An infinite number of those will actually add up to to one over the whatever the probability is„ÄÇ

 And since we're talking about traffic systems that we hope we' not blown up„ÄÇ

 we know that row is less than one„ÄÇAnd so that means that that piece is one over1 minus rh„ÄÇ

 which I plug back in up there and I end up with my resultÔºå which is„ÄÇ

The probability of their being zero customers is equal to one minus my traffic intensity„ÄÇ

Which sort of makes senseÔºå rightÔºå traffic intensity says I'm really busy or not busy„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 if I'm really busyÔºå then Roe is close to oneÔºå then the chance of they're being zero customers is really close to zero„ÄÇ

CoolÔºå so now I know what P0 isÔºå let me plug that back into my previous equation„ÄÇ

Right I had p of n equals P0 times lamb over mu raised the n power right and now I get the probability of being any„ÄÇ

Particular number of customers is equal to one minus my traffic intensity times my traffic intensity to that power„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so now I can calculateÔºå this is fantastic„ÄÇ This lets me know„ÄÇ

 lets me actually be able to calculate what's the probability that I have some number of customers„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

And it turns out from thatÔºå we can then extend this to a bunch of other„ÄÇ

Similar maths to get what we call the measures of effectiveness now i'm trying to analyze my system let me go ahead and see how that works and so for instance„ÄÇ

 I want to know what L is L was the number of customers in the entire system technically the expected value of that right on average how many customers do I have in the entire system„ÄÇ

WellÔºå that's going to be„ÄÇAnd times the probability they're being that number„ÄÇExpected valuedÔºå right„ÄÇ

 And so let's go ahead and add that up from0 to infinity„ÄÇ OkayÔºå now I know what„ÄÇ

I have an equation for PN that I can plug in there„ÄÇ

And that was one minus row times rh to the n power„ÄÇ The one minus row is a constant we can pull out„ÄÇ

 Now I have thisÔºå OkayÔºå this is almost like somebody's getting back at me likeÔºå okayÔºå smart guy„ÄÇ

 you knew what this one is rightÔºå This oneÔºå if I add this one up from zero infinity„ÄÇ

 Now what happens if we just multiplyÔºå we put another n in there And that one's a little bit harder to do basically„ÄÇ

WellÔºå basicallyÔºå you go find your math textbook and you open it up and you sayÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 what is that that sum and„ÄÇA little bit math later and you're left with a fairly elegant equation okay on average„ÄÇ

 the number of customers in your system is equal to lambda„ÄÇ

 the rate at which they're arriving divided by mu minus lambda„ÄÇ

 the difference between how fast you serve them and how fast they show up„ÄÇOkayÔºå kind of cool„ÄÇ

 And you can do similar equations to getÔºå like I saidÔºå we call this the measures of effectiveness„ÄÇ

s like there are a bunch of charts On averageÔºå How many are in the queue„ÄÇüòäÔºåOn average„ÄÇ

 how many are in the QÔºå if the Q is emptyÔºå I'm sorryÔºå if the Q is not emptyÔºå right„ÄÇ

 What's the averageÔºå if the queue is empty on averageÔºå there're 0 in the Q„ÄÇ OkayÔºå if it's not empty„ÄÇ

 So this is kind of like on averageÔºå you knowÔºå how big should my memory be„ÄÇ

For the the buffer for my router Okay to hold the packets in„ÄÇ WellÔºå what's on average if I have„ÄÇ

To store somethingÔºå how big is that going to beÔºüDon't use thatÔºå remember that's an average„ÄÇ

 you want to have more than on average amount of memory„ÄÇ

W is the waiting time right how long on averageÔºå how long are you in the system on average„ÄÇ

 how long do you spend in the queue look at the equations there on the right are actually fairly elegant right they're very easy to calculate and come up with and that's kind of the power of this QN theory„ÄÇ

I can get useful valuesÔºå Use measures„ÄÇBy bringing out my stopwatchÔºå measuring lambmbdas and mus„ÄÇ

 and then plugging them into some fairly simple equations„ÄÇJust kind of cool„ÄÇEdric„ÄÇ

That is correct right yeahÔºå we assume that the traffic that this that you aren't in trouble„ÄÇ

 okay which is probably a good enough equation„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇAssumption„ÄÇü§ß„ÄÇAnd Jeremy„ÄÇ

 I saw your chat questionÔºå yesÔºå so queuing theory assumes that all of the servers are all identical„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå remember the mu and La does have non identical systems„ÄÇ

 you can still do it with queuing theoryÔºå but now you have to have a multi stage system and you have to be able to know„ÄÇ

On averageÔºå how many customers go to the fast system versus the slow system and it becomes a multi stage queuing system„ÄÇ

To get to these really elegant equationsÔºå by the way„ÄÇ

 we made an assumption and that was that C was oneÔºå we had one server„ÄÇ

Oftentimes we want to have multiple servers so this is in the textbook right now you know chapter three„ÄÇ

 the next chapter what happens if I have more than one server what do I do Those are MMC systems right I have some number of servers we're going to use the C for that„ÄÇ

 but other than that things are still pretty similar„ÄÇThe Lambda„ÄÇ

 the rate at which customers show up is still the sameÔºå it's still an independent random value„ÄÇ

 so I can still use Lambda for that„ÄÇHoweverÔºå my service rate is now different„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 each individual server is still working at the same rate„ÄÇ But now I have multiple servers„ÄÇ

 and I have to be able to handle that„ÄÇ So that means I'm going„ÄÇIf all my servers are in play„ÄÇ

 then my service rate is actually CMUÔºå I'm actually able to get all of the servers each working at mu amount of work„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå if I have less than that„ÄÇThen I don't actually have a seen you amount of work„ÄÇ

 I only have the number amount of work of the servers that are in play„ÄÇ

And so my rate transition diagram is a little bit differentÔºå I still have a bunch of states„ÄÇ

And the probability of each of those and the arrival rates are still all lambda„ÄÇ

But the departure ratesÔºå you notice are now differentÔºå right„ÄÇ

 The departure rate out of state  one is muÔºå The departure rate out of state 2 is two times mu because I had two servers each being able to do mu amount of work basically„ÄÇ

 And so they get rid of customers twice as fast as if you only have one„ÄÇ

And that keeps going up until you hit C servers„ÄÇOkayÔºå you'd have three muÔºå four muÔºå five mu„ÄÇ

 but at some point you hit the number of servers you have and from then on out„ÄÇ

 the departure rate is just C mu„ÄÇOkayÔºå if you have 10 servers and 14 and you're in state 14 because you have 14 customers„ÄÇ

You're still only able to get 10 servers employed doing anything„ÄÇ

And then I can't believe I said that this was a similar derivation it is the process is very similar right we go through the same kind of flow balance equations and we rewrite them and stuff„ÄÇ

 the derivations just look uglier okay even though they're following the same process and it's because of this discontinuity„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and the balance works differently on one side of the discontinuity versus the other right„ÄÇ

 so the flow equation you have at C plus5 is different from the equation you have at state two„ÄÇ

And so you're you're going to have this kind of discontinuity in your equations and because the the service„ÄÇ

Youve got the one mu two mu three mu going onÔºå you end up with stuff like you'll notice C factorial shows up on the bottom of that second equation„ÄÇ

Because we're adding up the amount of work that's being done for all of them kind of things„ÄÇ

 and so the equations look a lot uglier and frankly„ÄÇ

 the derivations are uglier even though it follows the same sort of process„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇYeahÔºå I don't like„ÄÇ

 I don't much like derivations„ÄÇ I really don't like ugly derivations„ÄÇ

 So instead I'm just going to say here are the equations„ÄÇ

That are kind of like at the end of the chapterÔºå let's go ahead and just use them„ÄÇ

So if you have an MMC system„ÄÇYou can plug numbers into thereÔºå right„ÄÇ

 You can measure your lambda is amused you know what C is„ÄÇRight„ÄÇ

 so you can plug this in or maybe you're trying to figure out what C should beÔºå okayÔºå plug in nine„ÄÇ

 plug in 10Ôºå see what happens to„ÄÇTo your waiting times and things like that„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so not quite as elegant equationsÔºå but at least we have equations now that will let us analyze those sorts of systems„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå I have a couple of examples in here„ÄÇTypically when I give this lecture I then work out these examples on a document camera I discovered today when I showed up that I don't have a document camera okay so I can like I can wave a solution in front of you but I don't think that's going to be all that useful so let me just go ahead and step through some of the examples and talk about them and I will post the solutions up on the website for you to see my workout stuff and„ÄÇ

You can ask questions and Pis if you need„ÄÇSo this first example just saysÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 I'm using my stopwatchÔºå I have measured seven customers coming into a system with one server„ÄÇ

And here are the values right so the first customer shows up at time twoÔºå I'm sorry„ÄÇ

 this is the inter arrival time„ÄÇFirst customer show up at time 0 rightÔºå and takes„ÄÇ

Two time units before the next customer shows up„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so time the interri time between them is this first column„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 the service time for them is the bottom one„ÄÇ So the first customer shows up at time 0„ÄÇ

There doesn't have to waitÔºå immediately goes into service once one time unit later is gone„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 time twoÔºå the next customer shows upÔºå takes three time units for service„ÄÇRightÔºå time3Ôºå the„ÄÇ

Third customer shows up okay at that point it's going to have to wait because this guy is in service and so kind of managing all this we end up kind of having to keep track of okay„ÄÇ

 at any point in time who's in the queue and who's not in the queue and how long is that queue and so that's kind of the point of this question you end up with you know I've got inputs and outputs and then let's figure out at each of those times how many customers are in service and how many are in the queue„ÄÇ

And from thatÔºå we then can calculate what„ÄÇYou know„ÄÇ

 what our landism views are and from that we can figure out measures of effectiveness„ÄÇ

For this system„ÄÇWould I be able to use a law like little's law„ÄÇ

 Littles law is a general purpose equationÔºå right„ÄÇSo I guess obviously that one would work„ÄÇ

CompletelyÔºå could I use a G G1 equationÔºüFor this system„ÄÇOkayÔºå sureÔºå it has one server„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so that one would work fine„ÄÇ How about an M1 equationÔºå Would that work„ÄÇÊòØ„ÄÇÊ≤°„ÄÇWellÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 so if you wanted to use an MM1 equationÔºå you would have to look at these interrival times and be able to prove that they are independent of each other okay„ÄÇ

 and I've made no such statements and I'm not sure from our math whether we could actually do that or not„ÄÇ

 so you could not use an NM1 equationÔºå at least without some more work„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

And you don't have to to solve this„ÄÇ This is mostly„ÄÇ

Bookkeeping to figure out what the length of the queue is at any point in time„ÄÇ

 and then you can average that over the entire time span of the scenario to figure out what your actual averages are„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå I have another couple examples in here I see I'm out of time„ÄÇ

 so I'm not going to worry about them too much if you have questions ask them on piazza„ÄÇBut yeah„ÄÇ

 these are the kinds of sort of things I think you ought to be able to do on a homework„ÄÇIÔºå recognize„ÄÇ

Please don't be too worried about the quizÔºå I certainly am not going to do this to you on the quiz„ÄÇ

Okay because it's not that I'm a nice guyÔºå I don't want to grade a problem that you guys have had to do this on okay maybe I'm a nice guy also so don't get too overhomed with and worried about queuing theory stuff I mostly want you'd be able to pick out it'd be nice if you knew what the parameters were So if I talked about something your lambda is for you knew what that meant okay and some the equations and being able to understand which equations would apply Okay I'm mostly not worried I'm gonna to give you the equation so giving you a problem where you know plug in numbers into an equation come up with answer is not all that interesting it's more which equation did you pick and why and is it a good pick those sorts of things okay„ÄÇ

All right„ÄÇokayÔºå there will be a review session that the Ts will be holding on Sunday at 4 PM„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 on do we have a zoom for that or„ÄÇGo to PiazzaÔºå there'll be something then to specify„ÄÇ

 come with questions„ÄÇOkayÔºå this is a great time to ask I didn't understand that thing in lecture5„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå can you explain it to me sort of thing OkayÔºå also„ÄÇ

 we'll be paying special attention to piazza If you do have questionsÔºå please post them there„ÄÇ

Please yeahÔºå prepare for this thing do well it'd be great Okay„ÄÇ

 so I will say goodbye I will not see you on Tuesday„ÄÇ

 I will be in a zoom meeting which I guess I'll be in this zoom at the time so that you can come here and ask questions if you are„ÄÇ

Taking the quiz and having issues with it„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 and I guess there's the possibility I would need to make an announcement during the quiz if I discovered that I wrote a problem incorrectly or had a weird interpretation„ÄÇ

 so pay attention to Piazza during the quiz„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇHave a great weekendÔºå everybody„ÄÇ

I'll see you in a week„ÄÇAllrightÔºå bye bye„ÄÇ
