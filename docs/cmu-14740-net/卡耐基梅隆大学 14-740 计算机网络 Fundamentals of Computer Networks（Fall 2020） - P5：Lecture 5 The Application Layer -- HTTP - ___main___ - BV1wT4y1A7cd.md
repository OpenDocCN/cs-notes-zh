OkayÔºå thank youÔºå Carartik„ÄÇü§ßAll rightÔºå you're on it„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇA coupleup things before we start„ÄÇ

 one is a note to you just hopefully you're keeping up with the schedule anyway and you know this„ÄÇ

 but you have a lab that is due in a week„ÄÇSo next Tuesday you should have completed La zero„ÄÇ

 La zero is all about using Wire Shark to examine some very simple protocols and mostly getting you familiar with how wire shark works„ÄÇ

I also want to point out next time there's a review of the mocaitrus paper I think this is great paper mocaittris is the guy who invented the domain name system and made it all work and„ÄÇ

And so it's nice to hear from his own mouth what he did and what he thought was was going with it so definitely hopefully that's a fun read for„ÄÇ

Hopefully it's funÔºå but at the very least it should be a very informative read about how the domain name system works„ÄÇ

And finallyÔºå another warning„ÄÇIf you look a little further into the future„ÄÇ

 you'll notice that we have a quiz coming up two weeks from todayÔºå we'll be having a quiz„ÄÇ

Now normally the quizzes are in person events and obviously we can't do that this year and so I haven't quite figured out exactly how this is going to work and so„ÄÇ

Be flexibleÔºå rightÔºå We'll see what happens„ÄÇ I'd like to find a way that does not require us to be„ÄÇ

Yeah in person at all„ÄÇGenerally my quizzes are actually generalÔºå always in the past„ÄÇ

 the quizzes have been designed to be closed book and probably this one would be as wellÔºå but again„ÄÇ

 haven't completed the design of it also typically they are designed to be done in 45 minutes„ÄÇ

They generally have a lot of writing to themÔºå however„ÄÇ

 and I recognize that many of you English is not your first language for some of you„ÄÇ

 it's not even your second and„ÄÇAnd I don't want that to be a disadvantage to you I'm trying to figure out what you actually know not figure out what you can't you know are having trouble writing writing or things like that„ÄÇ

 so generally I try for them not to be time crunchches and so I usually would design them in such a way that I think a fluent reader of English who knew what they were doing could get it done in 45 minutes and then I would give you the entire class period for it„ÄÇ

Probably will do something like that as well„ÄÇTypically there have been a few multiple choice questions and then a bunch of short answers and a couple of kind of workout sorts of situations again„ÄÇ

 haven it designed it more details to come„ÄÇwould like to point out just make sure you understand the scope of this quiz it'll cover everything up to that lecture„ÄÇ

 so that's the 29th we will have on the Thursday previously just completed thequeuing theory lecture„ÄÇ

And so that means all of that material is ready to go„ÄÇIf you are having any troubles at all„ÄÇ

You know please let us help you outÔºå come talk to TAÔºå come talk to me during my office hours„ÄÇ

 and we'll be glad to try to get you on trackÔºå okayÔºüLast lectureÔºå we„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇ

When Jeremyerem's asking about organizing a study groupÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 I think study groups are a fantastic mechanismÔºå in factÔºå let me mention something really quickly„ÄÇ

I've had a bunch of students in the past who on the first quiz or they'll come to me after the first quiz and I'll say„ÄÇ

 I didn't do well on your quizÔºå I'm not sure why and we'll start examining it and I'll discover that their study mechanism was to look through the slides„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and they would kind of look at the slides and sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 this one is about you know ISPs and I understand what an IXP is and things like that and that would you know and they they got to the point where they felt very comfortable looking at the slides and thinking about the topics that were on the slides„ÄÇ

And therefore thought they knew the material„ÄÇThe trouble is„ÄÇ

 what they had trained themselves to do was to recognize knowledge„ÄÇ

They were looking at a slide and they were seeing stuff printed there and they were sayingÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 I must understand this because I know what this means„ÄÇüò°ÔºåAnd I don't write quizzes like that„ÄÇ

 I don't give you a slide and sayÔºå do you know thisÔºå That's not what the the quiz is„ÄÇ

 The quiz is the other way aroundÔºå rightÔºå The quiz is asking a question„ÄÇ

 and you have to produce the knowledge„ÄÇ So's like you have to write the slide for that question„ÄÇ

And that's not what many students train themselves to do„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so instead of looking at the slides and sayingÔºå do I know this„ÄÇ

 first off you have lesson objectives and so I would highly recommend you look at the lesson objective and ask yourself can I do this and prove to yourself that you can do that and as Jeremy points out in his desire for a study group„ÄÇ

One of the great things about a study group is you get in a situation where you are asked questions„ÄÇ

 somebody in the group will drill you and sayÔºå heyÔºå can you tell me what an IXP isÔºüAnd you're not„ÄÇ

 you're not being askedÔºå can you recognize the slideÔºå you are being askedÔºå here's a question„ÄÇ

 and you have to produce the knowledge„ÄÇTo create that answer„ÄÇ

 which is just what you will do in the quiz„ÄÇ And so having way to„ÄÇ

To train yourself to practice the same things that you'll do on the quiz is a better way of getting a good score on the quiz so i'm thumbs up with Jeremy study groups are fantastic can you make an can you give an example of the types of questions or just a question you might ask so we can get a clear sense of what that distinction you were just talking about sure here's the„ÄÇ

Let's seeÔºå how do I do this in this„ÄÇOopsÔºå I'm not screen sharing anymoreÔºå am IÔºüOkay„ÄÇ

 so Jeremy is asking„ÄÇWhat kind of question might I askÔºå so here's a question I might ask„ÄÇ

What's the mission of the application layer notice the lesson objective describe the mission of the application layer okay I might ask you what data types does the application layer use or I might make it a multiple choice question„ÄÇ

Of packetÔºå frameÔºå messageÔºå and segmentÔºå which one is used by the application layer„ÄÇ

I might ask you in the HtTP protocolÔºå how is connection management handledÔºü

And what headers are used to specify itÔºüOr something like that okay„ÄÇ

 if you're looking for examples of things I will ask you„ÄÇ

 the lesson objectives should be your guide because this is how I create a quiz„ÄÇ

 I go to the lesson objectives and then I write the quiz from these lesson objectives„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so„ÄÇOhÔºå I didn't share that shoot it was such a great point and I wasn't sharing the screen man„ÄÇ

 zoom okay„ÄÇAll right onto real technical material last time we looked at how businesses interact and how they work together to take their networks and interconnect them which is the main goal of of the internet and so today now it is time to dig in and start our journey through the technical content through the different layers and how they work and so we're going to start off as I do with every layer we're going to do this over and over again in this course i'm going to talk about the theory behind the layer what the layer is trying to accomplish how it accomplishes it and then we're going to look at a couple of specific protocols in this case we'll look at htTP today„ÄÇ

And which is one of the foremost application protocols that's ever used„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_2.png)

All rightÔºå so what's going on in the application layer„ÄÇ

 I showed you this picture a couple lessons ago and I said this shows you you know here are applications and they connect to transport layer stuff and you know I showed you basically the whole stack„ÄÇ

And in this application layerÔºå I've got lots and lots of different applications that„ÄÇ

All want network services„ÄÇRight„ÄÇAnd so what we're going to do for the application layer is we get to ignore everything below us„ÄÇ

or almost everything below us right we do have to use the services of the transport layer to do whatever we want to do and so we will see a couple instances today where knowledge of what's going on with those particular protocols can be helpful„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå but for our purposes„ÄÇWe don't need to know all the details what we need to know is kind of what they're doing and how the service what affect the services have on the performance we get or whatever features we want at the application layer and so as an application developer you have to ask yourself what transport layer protocols do I want to use and of course to make that decision you need to know something about them so we might say oh TCP gives me reliable transport I should use that or UDP is a lot simpler because it's not doing the transport setup so let's use that or something like that„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_4.png)

Now what do I mean by that well here's the example and this will get a lot clearer when we look into the transport layer and figure out what's going on„ÄÇ

 but if I were at the application layer to requestÔºåA TCP connection„ÄÇ

 and I've said several times in the course that TCP is a connection oriented protocol„ÄÇ

Which means it has some overhead to set up that connection to make sure both sides are using the same understanding of the state of the connection„ÄÇ

ÂóØ„ÄÇWhat happens is there is a additional round trip of messages that go back and forth„ÄÇ

 So here's a sequence diagram„ÄÇ remember the sequence diagrams show„ÄÇ

Two or more participants who are communicating through timeÔºå so time is going down the page here„ÄÇ

And we send messagesÔºå so a client for instanceÔºå wanting to set up a TCP connection with the server would first have to send a message that basically is a pretty pleased may I connect to you message„ÄÇ

And if the server acceptsÔºå which means the server is actually running the protocol we want and isn't overburdened and decides he likes this client„ÄÇ

 whatever his reasons areÔºå the server can accept or reject if the server accepts„ÄÇ

 he does that by sending a message back„ÄÇAnd then the client gets to do what wants to do and so in this case let's request a file„ÄÇ

 the server will then send the fileÔºå I'm showing this is a big arrow because probably that's a lot more data getting transferred„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and then when we're doneÔºå we sayÔºå ohÔºå okayÔºå I got everything and we do that by again sending a message and the server says„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå got it all„ÄÇAnd so there's this extra overhead„ÄÇ

 there's these extra messages that have to go back and forth„ÄÇTo make this all work„ÄÇ

 we'll learn more about it when we get into TCP„ÄÇ

![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_6.png)

After the quiz„ÄÇSo what's going on in the application layer„ÄÇThe application La mission„ÄÇ

 the thing it doesÔºå okayÔºå I'm going to use the word mission for all of the layers throughout the course„ÄÇ

And what I mean by that is why do we have this layerÔºås what's its jobÔºå what's it doing„ÄÇ

 what does it doÔºå what's its missionÔºüThe application layer's mission is to provide access to network resources to allow us to write programs that can use the network that get bandwidth from the network when we communicate„ÄÇ

 that allow us to transport our message from place to place„ÄÇ

Every layer also has an addressing mechanismÔºå this is how you discuss„ÄÇ

 talk about the target of your communications„ÄÇAnd in the application layer„ÄÇ

 this one is pretty wide open„ÄÇWe're going to talk a lot about domain names and URLs because we're talking about HTTP today and we're talking about DNS next time„ÄÇ

But you should know that there are lots of different addressing mechanisms because„ÄÇ

What we're doing is we're getting an application to be able to describe another application that's running somewhere„ÄÇ

And so that addressing very often is very application specific„ÄÇAnd so„ÄÇ

URls and domain names are kind of generic addressing mechanisms„ÄÇ

But your TikTook handle or your Twitter handle or your Facebook name or whatever„ÄÇ

 those also turn out to be addresses at the application layer OkayÔºå because they're the way that„ÄÇ

Our TikTok client identifies who they are to a TikTok serverÔºå for instance„ÄÇ

 they're the way that the TikTok server knows thatÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 this data needs to go to this particular other„ÄÇInstance of the TikTok application that's running somewhere„ÄÇ

And so that dot is very significant on this line where I'm saying there's many„ÄÇ

 many more different types of addresses„ÄÇEach layer also has its own data type„ÄÇ

I tried to illustrate this with the different size envelopes during the demo that we did last week„ÄÇ

The data is going to be different at each layer and for the application the data is pretty wide open The data type is we call it a message we say applications send messages to each other and those messages conform to whatever protocol is being used So if you're writing„ÄÇ

A network layer applicationÔºå you're going to be specifying this is what my message format looks like because this is the data that my application needs to get from one machine to another„ÄÇ

If I'm writing a gameÔºå for instanceÔºå my message might have things likeÔºå you know„ÄÇ

Just you know created spell in this directionÔºå you know the target is that and that is the data format of that particular message„ÄÇ

But we're sending messages between application and application„ÄÇOkayÔºå so„ÄÇ

Our overview of the application layer is pretty thin because there aren't a whole lot of„ÄÇ

Things that bind us aren't things that you must do„ÄÇ

Let's then take a look at our first major protocolÔºå and that's HTTP„ÄÇ

 the hypertext transfer protocol that is designed as you can expect to transfer hypertext„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_8.png)

Nowve noticed I've pointed out that we're going to have these acronyms for a lot of things„ÄÇ

Networking is a field that is overwhelmingly acronym like and this is one of the things that originally put me off when I was working with networks and I thought it was made it complicated and burdensome and I recognized that having lots of these acronyms and throwing just around TCP a few times in UDP in my description a few minutes ago„ÄÇ

Theres just a bunch of these acronyms around I don't know what to do about that„ÄÇ

 but hopefully as we talk about them you'll get more familiar with them and you'll then start to be able to to parse and understand at the very base level let me point out that most of the acronyms that end with the letter P are some form of protocol so HtTP„ÄÇ

That's because we acroronnymize„ÄÇWe make part of the acronymÔºå the word protocol„ÄÇ

 and so we end up with a P at the end of a TCPÔºå UDP„ÄÇHtTPÔºå rightÔºü

I mean so that may help a little bit as you're trying to„ÄÇ

Take in all these acronyms and and use them OkayÔºå so you you actually use HtTP all the time„ÄÇ

It was designed as a way to get the data for web applications to operate and so hypertext transfer that was because the hypertext„ÄÇ

 the thing that is a web page needs to get transferred from machine to machine„ÄÇIt is a request reply„ÄÇ

ProtocolÔºå which means we have a message that asks a question and then we have a message that has the answer to that question„ÄÇ

That and so there by that natureÔºå there ends up being kind of a client server model that was part of the web from the beginning„ÄÇ

 but„ÄÇIt's kind of buried in the protocol now because there is this request reply model of communication„ÄÇ

The client that's your browser right asks a question like do you have this web pageÔºå the server„ÄÇ

 which is some machine running somewhere today it's most likely in a data center somewhere„ÄÇ

Repllies with a responseÔºå which isÔºå yesÔºå here's that file„ÄÇ Let me„ÄÇ

 let me put it into this protocol that will then transfer this„ÄÇ

This thing no longer does it have to be hypertext okay I guess never did it have to be„ÄÇ

 but when HTP first came out that was what it was used for„ÄÇ

 it's such a useful protocol though that it's used all over the place to moved data from one place to another„ÄÇ

It is ubiquitous in operating systemsÔºå you can get it running on little microcontrollers„ÄÇ

 it runs on supercomputersÔºå doesn't matter what operating system you're using or how it works„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_10.png)

Now HTTV first came out as the web was beginning right this is in some ways even more important than the HTML that what is the document format that we know for the web„ÄÇ

 that's the file format for web objects„ÄÇOr for one type of web object„ÄÇSo in the late 80s„ÄÇ

 Tim Burns LeeÔºå who's now serve B Lee to UN IÔºå was working on this way of moving„ÄÇ

Documentation around from computer to computer and he came up with HTP as part of that he said oh„ÄÇ

 I need a way to mark up my documents so let me design HTML and then he had oh I need a way to have the communicated between clients and servers„ÄÇ

 let me design HTTP as part of that„ÄÇAnd HdP„ÄÇKind of formally hit the ground in 93„ÄÇ

When HtTP version 1„ÄÇ0 came out„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ0„ÄÇWas not really a standards document so there is an RFC for it remember RFCs are there request for comments those are the standards documents of the web and RFC 1945 describes kind of how HTTP was working although frankly the source code for HTTP became the first real standards document and people ported that and figured out how it was working„ÄÇ

It was not a perfect protocolÔºå it did what it was supposed to do and did move documents back and forth„ÄÇ

But it had no way to control cachesÔºå and we'll talk a little bit about how it used TCP in ways that were not optimal„ÄÇ

In the late 90sÔºå a new version came out version 1„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ

 and this is kind of an interesting situation because 1„ÄÇ one„ÄÇ

Was moving into an area which had become very popular by then the web had taken off There were web servers on all sorts of different platforms„ÄÇ

 manyÔºå many different operating systems were supporting„ÄÇDifferent versions of the web servers„ÄÇ

 different companies were selling web servers and selling clients or mostly giving away clients in order to sell the servers„ÄÇ

And it turns out backwards compatibility became a big deal„ÄÇ What do we mean by thatÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 if I have a client that is using a different version of„ÄÇThe protocol from the server„ÄÇ

 you want those two to still be able to communicate to some degree„ÄÇ

 And so one do one couldn't just change everything„ÄÇIf it did„ÄÇ

 then the clients that already existed could not talk to the servers that„ÄÇWere available„ÄÇRaviÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 everybodyÔºå but Ravi can hear meÔºüOkayÔºå goodÔºå I'm sorryÔºå Robvi„ÄÇBut glad it's much not everyone„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇ

So by dealing with backward compatibilityÔºå they had to be able to let the large majority of servers„ÄÇ

 the large quantity of servers that were in existence talk to new clients and the same way„ÄÇ

 large body of existing clients had to be able to talk to new servers„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ

1 was a much improved spec that overcame some of the problems in 1„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ

And it survived for almost two decadesÔºå there is a 2„ÄÇ0 versionÔºå there's HTTP2 that was approved„ÄÇ

 it's been five years agoÔºå it's picked upÔºå I say slow adoption rate„ÄÇ

 but that's just in comparison to how fast 1„ÄÇ1 showed up„ÄÇ

And what it does is it focuses on optimizing how the actual data is„ÄÇMove back and forth in systems„ÄÇ

And there's some words here about things it does that you may or may not understand we'll talk a little bit about server push„ÄÇ

But we're not going to talk about 2„ÄÇ0 much todayÔºå and that's because it's really hard to teach„ÄÇ

Because it violates a lot of the layered architecture„ÄÇ

 it does things in order to make sure that the TCP and lower layers can operate better on the data and that means it's deliberately doing things that are the job of the transport layer and below and we haven't learned what the transport layer and below do so it's not really a good thing to talk about it now„ÄÇ

We may focusÔºå we may come back to this later on in the courseÔºå though„ÄÇ

So today we're going to focus on 1„ÄÇ1„ÄÇOkayÔºå so that the message itself„ÄÇ

 I guess I should point out any protocol„ÄÇWhich we have„ÄÇ

 which involves communication between a sender and a receiver„ÄÇ

 means that some bits are going to be sent from the sender to the receiver„ÄÇAnd therefore„ÄÇ

 we need to be very careful about the format of those bits„ÄÇ

 we need to know if I want to take my message and put it into this formatÔºå how do I do itÔºüüò°„ÄÇ

And on the receiving sideÔºå I now have a bunch of bits„ÄÇ

 how do I look at those bits and interpret them to make sure I understand what the message was supposed to be and so every protocol has message format„ÄÇ

As a primary or very important aspect of that protocol„ÄÇ

 making sure that you can translate into and out of the actual bits that are going to go across the wire is going to be very important„ÄÇ

And HttP's format„ÄÇIt includes two different types of messages there are requests and replies„ÄÇ

 as I mentioned earlierÔºå there's a client who asks questions and a server who answers them„ÄÇ

And the format for each of those has to be formally specified that you have to have„ÄÇ

You can't just sayÔºå wellÔºå you should put this information into the message„ÄÇ

 you have to say exactly how it gets transformed into the bits„ÄÇ

And most RFCs use a formal notation called Baus Now form named after two very famous computer scientists„ÄÇ

As a formal language to describe the actual message„ÄÇ

Adul Hadi is asking can a server request things tooÔºå a server can„ÄÇ

 but then it becomes a client in the mechanism„ÄÇYou knowÔºå for instance„ÄÇ

 you could imagine a server I ask a question of a server and the server therefore„ÄÇ

Needs to find an answer somehowÔºå it could go off and query a database and it typically wouldn't„ÄÇ

 but it could use HTP to make that happen„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇBut that's not so typically you know when my web browser talks to a web server„ÄÇ

 the server does not send me requests„ÄÇThe client sends requests to the server and the server responds to them„ÄÇ

and that's mostly because the way that model of communication works out„ÄÇ

 we don't need to have the server asking us stuff„ÄÇWe just when we need something„ÄÇ

 we ask the server for it„ÄÇOkayÔºå so I'm going to show you some pieces of Backus now format and I'm not asking you to become backus now experts„ÄÇ

 I'm just I want to give you a feel for how this backus now and this formal notation looks as we put together this„ÄÇ

This message format„ÄÇSo an HP message is either a request a response„ÄÇ

 I've said that here in English words„ÄÇAnd it might be possible for somebody to misinterpret them„ÄÇ

 and so in Baus now there's a formal way of saying and a message is equal to a request or a response and so that vertical bar is the backACus now operator meaning or„ÄÇ

Now this has just kicked the can down the road a little bit as you're trying to put together a message because you don't know what a request looks like or what a response looks like so you look further down the page of the RFC and there's a description you'll say oh request and response messages are made up of stuff and it turns out both of them are very similar and so there's a thing called a generic message requests and response„ÄÇ

In this languageÔºå become a specialization of a generic message„ÄÇBut both of them have a start line„ÄÇ

 so there's going to be some line of text that begins things followed by some headers„ÄÇ

Followed by blanklein„ÄÇFollowed by an optional message body„ÄÇAgain„ÄÇ

 this is English description and you would have lots of questions if you tried to write code based on these paragraphs here„ÄÇ

So instead we have backACus now format that in a more formal notation is able to say a generic message„ÄÇ

 a request or response message is a start line„ÄÇOkayÔºå again„ÄÇ

 we're kicking the can down the road a little bitÔºå what's a start line we'd have we'll see what that looks like„ÄÇ

In some other back now notation„ÄÇIn factÔºå is right here start line what that is„ÄÇ

 but for now a generic message is a start line followed byÔºå and then this asterisk means„ÄÇ

Zero or more of these things„ÄÇSo zero or more„ÄÇWellÔºå it's in parentheses now parentheses are also part of Baus now and lets us group things„ÄÇ

 so zero or more of a message header followed by a curlph„ÄÇCÔºå CfaÔºå what's a CRLF„ÄÇAnybody know„ÄÇ

It's a new line„ÄÇYesÔºå Cartik and Bailey„ÄÇCarriage return line feed that's what happens when you hit the return key on your keyboard and you go back to the beginning of the line this is basically saying you can write a message header and then you have to as a way of distinguishing it from the next thing that follows you have to have a line a carriage return line feed you have to have one of those return things„ÄÇ

And so having zero or more of these means I could have three message headers„ÄÇAnd in each case„ÄÇ

 I'll have a message header followed by a carriage return line feed message header„ÄÇ

 carriage return line feed messageer character return line feed„ÄÇ

 so this is basically backca now saying put each message header on its own line„ÄÇ

Followed by another character turn line feedÔºå so that means the message the last message header„ÄÇ

Would have a character turn line feed„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and now I have another one„ÄÇ So this is a blank line„ÄÇ

And then followed by the message body and the message body is in square brackets„ÄÇ

 square brackets are back is now format for optional„ÄÇ

 you do not actually have to have a message body if you don't want„ÄÇAnd so then you look upÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 what's a start lineÔºå well the start line is a request line or a status line„ÄÇThe requestÔºå thenÔºå is a„ÄÇ

Is a generic message that's been specialized because it has a request line at the front„ÄÇ

And it turns out we want to know more about these headers„ÄÇ

 some of them come from a there's basically a bunch of different headers„ÄÇ

 some of them are called general headers because they can be in requests or responses„ÄÇ

 some of them are only request headersÔºå some of them are things called entity headers etc„ÄÇ

 so this is kind of just the specialization of what's a request look like it looks very much like that generic message„ÄÇ

With some extra boundaries on it„ÄÇWhat are the headers well the headers actually provide some information about the request for the response right i'm asking you something and this isn't really the question but there's some more information about it right so maybe I want to know something about the date or time of a request or a date or time of the object I'm asking for maybe I'd like to pass along some information about my application„ÄÇ

Or maybe I'd like to know something about the server„ÄÇ

 and so those that those things get put into some of these headers„ÄÇWe mentioned caching control„ÄÇ

And and how you know 1„ÄÇ0 did not wasn't really amenable to caching and there's so in order to make it amenable 1„ÄÇ

1 added some more headers that would allow you to pass information about whether you're allowed to cache this object and for how long and things like that„ÄÇ

In totalÔºå in the 1„ÄÇ1 specÔºå there are 46 different headers„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so it's a bunch of them and if you were implementing a browser„ÄÇ

 you'd have to know what all of them did and you'd have to be able to make messages that have those headers in them and you'd have to be able to respond to messages that have those headers in them„ÄÇ

There is one of them that's specialÔºå and that is the host header„ÄÇ

 the host header is required on all requests„ÄÇAnd that's actually a change to 1„ÄÇ

 one because the way servers were used had changed„ÄÇPrior to1 dot one„ÄÇ

When you made a request to a web serverÔºå it was assumed that the web server had all of the web files for a website„ÄÇ

And so when you asked for index„ÄÇhtmÔºå it was obvious what you were looking for because there would only be the one index HTML for this particular website„ÄÇ

In the intervening years„ÄÇThis idea of hosting companies popped up and the idea that you'd have a server that is a physical machine that was hosting multiple websites„ÄÇ

In 1„ÄÇ0 that meant you had to actually have multiple IP addresses and you had to have multiple web server instances„ÄÇ

 actually the application running one per websiteÔºå and so that got really complicated for a hosting web service so now that we have a host„ÄÇ

Header here„ÄÇWe can talk to a particular web server and that web server can actually be serving data on many different websites and the host is saying„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå I'm actually interested in you know this particular websiteÔºå which may be one of many that you„ÄÇ

 the web serverÔºå happen to be handling„ÄÇThe request line„ÄÇ

 the thing at the top of the request again back to now format saysÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 that's a method followed by SpÔºå any idea what a SP isÔºüThe fact that it's capitalized is a hint„ÄÇ

Yeah Stephanno that's right that's a space okay again we need a formal definition and actually in the language there is a you know„ÄÇ

 it does say here's what a CRLF is and here's what a space is here are the bits you would use for each of those„ÄÇ

Then there's a request URIÔºå URI is a fancy term for the thing we think of as a URL„ÄÇ

Not quite but close enough for today's discussion„ÄÇFollowed by another space„ÄÇ

 followed by the HTTP versionÔºå followed by Care return linefe„ÄÇWhat's a methodÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 a method is one of the words options or get or had or post„ÄÇ

 and here because these are in double quotesÔºå that means you need the actual characters OPT IONS„ÄÇ

To mean optionsÔºå et cetera„ÄÇAnd the whole language then is done this way„ÄÇ

 there are a couple pages of Fus now format that would let you as an implementer know oh„ÄÇ

 this is exactly what these bits mean in this message or vice versa„ÄÇ

 here's how I actually create the method„ÄÇStephahanTceÔºå I think is a later edition„ÄÇactually„ÄÇ

 I'm not entirely sure about that„ÄÇhave looked up„ÄÇSo here's an example right so i've described the back now format for one of them let's actually see one and see what it look how it maps to what we know so far about that format so here i'm sending a request and the request has this is the request line the first line is this thing method space method is get there's the space here's the UI„ÄÇ

Which looks like part of a URL that we're looking forÔºå followed by spaceÔºå followed by my version„ÄÇ

 this is an HTTP1„ÄÇ1 request„ÄÇFollowed by carriage turn line feed and then a bunch of headers and each of the headers is„ÄÇ

 you know here's the headerÔºå character turn line feedÔºå another headerÔºå character turn line feed„ÄÇ

 etc ceaÔºå headerÔºå carriage return turn line feed„ÄÇAnd then another carriage return line feed that makes for blank space„ÄÇ

 and then I've got no message body because that's optionalÔºå we're done„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so this is a request I'm sayingÔºå hey„ÄÇHeyÔºå web serverÔºå I believe you serve the cmu„ÄÇedu website„ÄÇ

And I would like a web object which is known as images slash logos„ÄÇhtm now this„ÄÇ

Traditionally we've thought of it as a file and this is the like the path to the file doesn't have to be that way„ÄÇ

 but often is„ÄÇOkayÔºå and of courseÔºå if you buy something on Amazon„ÄÇ

 the URIs we're using have all kinds of crazy numbers and letters and query description things in them„ÄÇ

 and so these can be more complicated than just looks like a file path„ÄÇ

I mentioned that there are several different request methods and so we should talk briefly about what each of them does get is a very is probably the most common one„ÄÇ

 this is asking hey web serverÔºå I'd like to get this objectÔºå I'd like to have a copy of this object„ÄÇ

ÂóØ„ÄÇAnd you knowÔºå and I specifyÔºå in this caseÔºå I'm looking for the logos„ÄÇ

htl file you know that that you told me you keep in an images directory or something like that„ÄÇ

The headers can modify this method„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so the method is get„ÄÇ

 I would like to get an object from you„ÄÇIn the headers„ÄÇ

 there's ways to make it a conditional get to be likeÔºå wellÔºå maybe I want this„ÄÇ

And so there's an if modified sense and an if match header„ÄÇ

Maybe a couple more that let you say I'd like to get this thing„ÄÇ

 but only if it's updated right so if modified S means you know I have a copy from yesterday„ÄÇ

Of that file of that web objectÔºå and if it's changedÔºå I'd like a new versionÔºå but if it hasn't„ÄÇ

 it's coolÔºå I already got a copy„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ1 also allowed for partial get„ÄÇ

 this is probably the update that has had the most impact on the world„ÄÇBecause previous to this„ÄÇ

 you would ask for a web object and you would have to get the whole thing I either knew„ÄÇ

I don't ask for it and I don't get any of it or I gotÔºå you know here's the whole cat videoÔºå whatever„ÄÇ

 the whole thing„ÄÇA partial get lets me specifyÔºå I like it from Bte number X to Bte number Y„ÄÇ

And this lets us do things like create Netflix and streaming services where the web object itself is huge„ÄÇ

But I'd like to be able to scrub back and forth„ÄÇWe don't want to be watching„ÄÇ

Ted Laso and be halfway through and you know the person you're watching with says„ÄÇ

 wait a minute I missed that while I was in the bathroomÔºå can you go back 30 secondsÔºü

And in going back 30 seconds we'd have to do a request and get the whole episode again from the website„ÄÇ

 we want to be able to request and say ohÔºå we actually want from you know the bite that was 30 seconds ago to this point and so yeah„ÄÇ

 technology can have real impact on everybody's livesÔºå yeah great„ÄÇ

Head is a method that willll is basically asking about„ÄÇSorryÔºå I'm missing part of the chat„ÄÇI'm sorry„ÄÇ

Stteafness are„ÄÇOkayÔºå never mind looks like re taken care of it Okay so head is another method that lets me ask for metadata about something so it's kind of like a directory lookup I'd like to know something about this web object I'd like to know what headers you would give me if I asked for it but I don't actually need it„ÄÇ

There are optionsÔºå there is an option request method that lets me askÔºå hey serverÔºå are you a 1„ÄÇ

0 server or you 1„ÄÇ1 serverÔºå things like that„ÄÇAnd there's post post lets you go the other way so get ask for data to come from the server post allows me to provide some data to give to the server„ÄÇ

 so for instanceÔºå if I have created my TikTok video and I would like to send it to the server we would post that right or you know here's my Gmail that I have just typed a new email message and I need to transfer that data to the web server that would be put into a post„ÄÇ

Into an HGP request„ÄÇBut the request is to post this data„ÄÇAnd so here's another example of„ÄÇ

 but this time it's of a response„ÄÇSo we' made a request we sayÔºå heyÔºå I'd like to get that thing„ÄÇ

 I get a response coming backÔºå their response is the same as„ÄÇOur generic message„ÄÇ

 but it has a different start line„ÄÇRemember the start line was different for requests and responses„ÄÇ

 a status line is not method space UIÔºå et ceteraÔºå a status line that comes back in the response is the HTTP version followed by space followed by status code„ÄÇ

 followed by space„ÄÇFollowed by a reason phraseÔºå Kur turn linefe„ÄÇI love this„ÄÇ

 the engineers who put this together were human and knew the people who read these are human and so in this thing they include a status code it's kind of like an error code„ÄÇ

But you knowÔºå error code warning code or good thing code so the status code just tells you„ÄÇ

 did your request make sense and I'm able to serve itÔºüAnd instead of just giving you the number„ÄÇ

 they also tell you what it means„ÄÇNow what it means we could all look it upÔºå it's defined in the RFC„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå status code 200 means okay„ÄÇüò°ÔºåThat's what there's a table in the RFC that tells us that„ÄÇ

But that's annoying to have to always look it up and yeahÔºå you'd remember what 200 is„ÄÇ

 but you might not remember what a 302 is„ÄÇOkayÔºå and so having a short phrase that kind of nudges your memory„ÄÇ

 I think is fantastic about thatÔºå even though from a engineering perspective it means we actually have to transfer more bits„ÄÇ

 these bits are redundant because they mean the same thing as the status quo„ÄÇBut I like it„ÄÇ

And so an example has HtTP 1„ÄÇ1Ôºå so this is coming from a 1„ÄÇ1 server„ÄÇIt has status code 200„ÄÇ

 which means okayÔºå which means heyÔºå we did itÔºå you asked for something here it is„ÄÇ

 your request was all good„ÄÇHere are a bunch of header lines that tell us we're going to close this connection now„ÄÇ

 here's the date that we're actually doing this yeah the date that we're doing this here's information about the server„ÄÇ

 here's the date about the file okay so the object I'm giving you was last modified at this time it's 6821 bytes long and it is here's the MIme type for it which specifies the bits I'm giving you are of this format in this case it's a HTML file„ÄÇ

Which is specifying text as opposed to an image JpeEG fileÔºå for instance„ÄÇ

 or a video movie file or something like that„ÄÇFollowed by that blank line that comes after the headers and then all of the data„ÄÇ

 here's the actual HTML of the web object„ÄÇWe're specifying„ÄÇMakes sense„ÄÇ

What are the status quo where did you mentioned mind type was that in the head or somewhere don yeah„ÄÇ

 so this content type thingÔºå there's another whole working group and another whole RFc that has come up with ways of defining„ÄÇ

You knowÔºå these bits may be in these different formatsÔºå how do we tell you what the format isÔºü

And so text slash HTML is a mime type„ÄÇThat's okay„ÄÇYeahÔºå it turns out„ÄÇStandards have layers too„ÄÇ

 there's standard for stuff in standards„ÄÇOkayÔºå the status code itself is just a number and there are a couple dozen different possible status codes„ÄÇ

They are categorized in„ÄÇIncreasing order of badness„ÄÇ

And so you start off with things that start with oneÔºå the 100s are not a big deal„ÄÇ

 those are all just informational just saying hey yeahÔºå we're good„ÄÇ

 the 200s it turns out you can get a correct answer in several different ways and so there are 200 is okay and there's some others„ÄÇ

300s are slightly bad they're saying heyÔºå you know you asked for something but it turns out you didn't ask for quite correctly„ÄÇ

 maybe you need to go talk to a different server to get it or you need to ask for it in a different way and so„ÄÇ

I can't tell you the answerÔºå but I can give you some hints as how to ask for the answer„ÄÇ

The 400s mean there's a mistakeÔºå and this is where we start to assign blame„ÄÇ

400s are a problem on the client side„ÄÇOkayÔºå you ask for it poorly or something like that„ÄÇ

 the 500s are server errors okay the problem is on the server sideÔºå yepÔºå you ask for it correctly„ÄÇ

 I can't do it for you„ÄÇIt's500s„ÄÇ

![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_12.png)

So here are some examples we've talked about okay before 200 happens luckily almost all the time right yes„ÄÇ

 I got your dataÔºå I got your requestÔºå I can help you with it„ÄÇ

 here's what you asked for right 200 perfectly great„ÄÇ

301 that's one of those redirection ones I know what you're asking forÔºå but we moved it„ÄÇ

Right you're asking for itÔºå you know using I don't know the old name of our company„ÄÇ

 but we got acquired and so now we went through and renamed everything I can tell you what the new location is and there's a header a location header that would be like„ÄÇ

This is almost frustrating right why don't you know what I'm asking for you know where it is„ÄÇ

 why don't you just give it to meÔºüInsteadÔºå we want to tell the client so the client knows to update any information it might have„ÄÇ

 so it isn't always asking for the wrong thing„ÄÇYou probably have seen 404s before when you mistype something in a URL„ÄÇ

 you end up withÔºå I don't knowÔºå I can't find that thing you asked for„ÄÇ

And so 400s are client errors because you asked for it incorrectly„ÄÇ500„ÄÇ

So one example is there's a server problem and the problem is the server isn't good enough had„ÄÇ

HtTP2 requestÔºå but I'm a 1„ÄÇ1 serverÔºå so I can't understand anything beyond the fact that you asked for something HtP2 question I've seen 404s in the context of going have I typed the URL incorrectly but the information is just so long on the server it's a dead page so why is it still considered a client error it's a dead page because what you asked for doesn't exist„ÄÇ

Right so it's a dead link you yesÔºå you at one time in the past that that thing was there okay in this case„ÄÇ

And this is often the caseÔºå you knowÔºå when likeÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 somebody just stops updating their blog or deletes their blog or takes out that website information„ÄÇ

 they're not nice enough to leave behind the breadcrumbs that would let the server know where the new information is if it's just a dead link„ÄÇ

Then the files just gone away„ÄÇ We don't know how to get„ÄÇ

You know it's not like we can find an archive somewhere and so the thing you are asking for is indistinguishable from a URL that you mistyped the server doesn't know the difference„ÄÇ

Between something that used to be good and something that's just been wrong forever„ÄÇ

 does that makes sense„ÄÇYesÔºå it does thank youÔºå all right„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_14.png)

And I like to collect pictures of cool stuff and I think these are great and I'd love to have you know a license plate that basically says you can't find me here and I'd love for like„ÄÇ

You knowÔºå when the police uses automatic license plate trackers„ÄÇ

 it'd be awesome if this one would actually send a 404 message„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_16.png)

But I doubt that it does„ÄÇAll rightÔºå so when I ask for something„ÄÇ

 let me say I go to some website and say hey Google give me index with HTML„ÄÇ

 so index with HTML is the default kind of„ÄÇTop starting page for a website„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 let me have that thing what i'm asking for is the HTML the„ÄÇ

And HTML is a text based format that is the markup of the contents„ÄÇ

So it will have you here's the text in it so the the words down here donate to help refugees and migrants and urgenty that will be part of the the HTML because that's a little bit of the content and then there's stuff around it to say oh this should be centered it should be in this font„ÄÇ

 it should be whatever„ÄÇOkayÔºå and maybe it will specify oh you should put a particular image here right there's a logo file that at one time was in a gIF or GIF I won't get into that argument file„ÄÇ

And basicallyÔºå the HTML will specify put that image right here„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and that's all the stuff that's in HTML okay not we're not going to teach HTML or anything like that you'll see a little bit of in the lab it's okay„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_18.png)

All rightÔºå so if I was going to ask Google„ÄÇFor its index do H file„ÄÇ

 So here is how I would do that rightÔºå I'm going to put together a request message getÔºå Here's my UI„ÄÇ

 which is the index H„ÄÇ I'm version 1„ÄÇ one„ÄÇ you know the host I'm talking about is Google com„ÄÇ

My blank lineÔºå there's my request„ÄÇAm I going to get the logo fileÔºüAs well„ÄÇ

 since the logo file is part of what I need to render this thing„ÄÇNo„ÄÇ

 you would because you didn't ask for it„ÄÇThat's rightÔºå I asked for index on H„ÄÇ

 I did not ask for logo„ÄÇ Jeff or GF„ÄÇso I'm not going to get it„ÄÇ

 I'm just going to get what I asks for„ÄÇEvery time you request something„ÄÇ

 you're asking for a single object„ÄÇüò°ÔºåThat object is an HTML file or an image file or a movie file or a CSS file or whatever„ÄÇ

JavascriptÔºå right I'm asking for a single thing and I'm going to get a single thing„ÄÇ

OkayNow this is one of the things that the 2„ÄÇ0 version of HTQP has transformed„ÄÇ

 and that is that when I ask for somethingÔºå the server is allowed to send me stuff that I didn't ask for„ÄÇ

Under 1„ÄÇ1Ôºå I ask for something the server can give me that will hopefully give me that thing if it can„ÄÇ

But it won't give me anything else„ÄÇHDP2 the server can say wait me you just asked for the homepage I know in a minute you're going to ask me for the logo so let me just go ahead and send it to you we call that server push„ÄÇ

We don't have that in 1„ÄÇ1„ÄÇYeahÔºå so each request asks for a single object„ÄÇOkay that objectÔºå of course„ÄÇ

 will often have links to other things„ÄÇOkayÔºå so YahooeÔºå noÔºå if I ask for the HTML thing„ÄÇ

 I get the HTML thing„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇThen when I get that I then parse it and the browser starts looking through and says oh here's a CSS file here's a JavaScript file I need and it then creates more HTTP requests to go get each of those there's no mechanism to bundle a whole bunch into like some web archive format thingy and send us here's everything you need for a website„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåOkayThe idea is you ask for somethingÔºå we give you that thingÔºå if you want more„ÄÇ

 you can always ask for more„ÄÇOkayÔºå and the advantage is„ÄÇ

It may be that I don't need everything I actually have that JavaScript file already„ÄÇ

So I don't want you to send it to me againÔºå it's been cached in my browser cache„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

So let me just get the things I'm asking for„ÄÇAll rightÔºå so this„ÄÇ

Can lead to some interesting behavior and so„ÄÇThere's some connection management issues„ÄÇ

 the way that HTTP uses TCP that originally were not optimized and one of the stories of HTTP is we've done more to make HTTP work well with TCP„ÄÇ

You're going to learn TCP in a couple weeksÔºå okayÔºüTCP is a transport protocol that is really good„ÄÇ

 it's actually brilliantly good at moving mass amounts of data through the network„ÄÇ

 and it does lots of things to optimize for when you need to send lots of data through the network„ÄÇ

The problem is some of those actively work against short requests or requests for little amounts of data„ÄÇ

 for instanceÔºå one of the things it does for collision control„ÄÇ

 we'll talk about this again one of the things TCP deliberately does is it slows things down at the beginning„ÄÇ

 it actually sends slower than it could until it has a good understanding of what the network will handle because it doesn't want to overwhelm some router somewhere and bury it in a bunch of requests„ÄÇ

And so if you're sending a short amount of dataÔºå that means you're not using the bandwidth efficiently„ÄÇ

Also you have this back and forth thing right we've talked a little bit about this„ÄÇ

 let's say I want to get the front page of CMU's website„ÄÇSo I put together my HP request„ÄÇ

 but before I send that with TCPÔºå I have to open a TCP connection to the server and so that that's that picture I showed you way back at the beginning where the client sends a„ÄÇ

You motherÔºå may I sort of requestÔºå heyÔºå serverÔºå please may I connect to you„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and the web server then„ÄÇResponds with another message back the other way yes„ÄÇ

 you may connect to me and at that point there's now this connection and so now the client is allowed to send data the client then actually sends the HtTP request for index„ÄÇ

 HTML the server gets the request it goes and finds that file which it's very good at it puts it into a response message here you go Hp1„ÄÇ

1 to 100 okay here's the competitors here's the data all that gets sent back„ÄÇThe server then is done„ÄÇ

 rightÔºå you ask for something„ÄÇWe respondedÔºå we're going to close up that TCP connection„ÄÇ

The browser now has the HTML for CMUs„ÄÇFront page and if any of you have looked at that recently„ÄÇ

 you know there's more stuff going on„ÄÇThe browser is immediately going to start looking through that HTML and making a list of all of the other stuff we have to get„ÄÇ

 ohhÔºå there's pictures of alumni and pictures of students in masks around campus and there's JavaScript to make things slide back and forth and transform„ÄÇ

Let's go get all that stuff„ÄÇOkay and every time you go get that stuff„ÄÇ

 you start back with step one mother may I can I please connect you„ÄÇ

 yes you can let me have that JavaScript file here's that JavaScript file we close the connection„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå oh now I need the CSS fileÔºå hey mother may I please connect to youÔºå yes you may okay„ÄÇ

 and so we spend a lot of time opening and closing these connections„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 because we're asking for short stuffÔºå usually„ÄÇ

![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_20.png)

And so if I look at this from a modeling perspectiveÔºå we can count the time yes„ÄÇ

 you could use a stopwatchÔºå okayÔºå to know exactly how much time it is„ÄÇ

 but that would vary depending on network conditions and where you are versus the server and so we abstract it a little bit we often measure things in round trip times„ÄÇ

And so our calculation is going to have a two round trip times„ÄÇ

 one round trip time is the time when I send a message and I get a response where I sayÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 can I connect to youÔºå yes you can„ÄÇHeyÔºå can I have this fileÔºå yesÔºå here it is„ÄÇüò°ÔºåOkay„ÄÇ

 and one round trip time to get the start of the file and because we sometimes ask for small files and sometimes ask for big files„ÄÇ

 then the transmission time will also add to this as a kind of a variable„ÄÇ

And so that means every time I open a TCP connection„ÄÇ

It takes two roundship times plus transmission time before I have my data and can start using it now yes„ÄÇ

 there's another round trip time here at the endÔºå but I'm going to ignore that from a performance modeling perspective because that's just cleanup yes that has to happen but at this point after two roundship times and a transmission time I now have my data and so I can start rendering it„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_22.png)

Okay„ÄÇSo this is problematic two round trip times plus transmission time for each object I need Okay„ÄÇ

 for each of the pictures on my website for each of those„ÄÇManyÔºå manyÔºå many JavaScript„ÄÇ

Things that we have out there and noÔºå I'm not saying runship time is constantÔºå in fact„ÄÇ

 it never will be completely constant„ÄÇOkay it can be very dynamic we're just kind of abstractly modeling it here's a way of comparing„ÄÇ

 even though i'm not comparing down to the seconds„ÄÇI'm comparing to be able to sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 this one looks better because it has more round trip times or less transmission times or whatever„ÄÇ

Round trip timesÔºå I guess I should„ÄÇI don't know if this is obvious„ÄÇ

 but I should point out the round trip time is usually orders of magnitude more than the CPU time that it's going to take to render things„ÄÇ

 stuff like that„ÄÇThe round trip time is really the painful partÔºå and so we're counting those„ÄÇ

And that's part of what the user sees that„ÄÇIn fact„ÄÇ

 it used to be this is a kudgen story right back in the day right back in the day the network was slow enough that you would actually see the pictures as they were being rendered you could see them being drawn kind of line by line in the web browser as they came in and know because the network was„ÄÇ

Much slower than it is today„ÄÇAnd so you actually felt that latency„ÄÇ

We don't feel that so much these daysÔºå things have been optimized quite a bit„ÄÇ

So the problem here is that TCP„ÄÇIs optimized but it's optimized per connection right every connection will do the best it can to transport large amounts of data down that connection„ÄÇ

 but there's no sense of kind of optimizing cross many connections and so you are paying for stuff you're starting up you're sending these messages back and forth„ÄÇ

You're in a slow start phase where you're deliberately not using all the bandwidth„ÄÇ

 you're slowly increasing the amount of bandwidth you use all sorts of stuff that you're paying and oftentimes for the HTP connections we have I'm asking for the index file right that's just you know a couple kilobytes in size„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and so that goes into like three or four TCP segments„ÄÇ

And so we never get anywhere close to the optimization level before„ÄÇ

It's done and we close that connection„ÄÇ

![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_24.png)

We'll learn more about this when we get to transport„ÄÇAnother issueÔºå you know I go to Reddit„ÄÇ

 I load this up I in creating this picture for the userÔºå we've sent lots and lots of requests„ÄÇ

 we've gotten lots and lots of responses for each of these files„ÄÇ

 each of these tiny little pictures and you know these little images that show up all those are separate transactions with the browser„ÄÇ

 you all that kind of stuffÔºå the fe icon that goes in the browser„ÄÇ

 all that stuff is a bunch of communication back and forth and back and forth„ÄÇ

And you know what happens right as soon as I type Reddit in you know and ask for all this stuff that's when my boss comes in the room and so I have to like close this out quickly or I decide„ÄÇ

 oh yeahÔºå I've already been to Reddit this morning I should actually get some work done„ÄÇ

And you close this out„ÄÇAnd in doing soÔºå you've actually paid all the costs at the beginning to get this thing„ÄÇ

 and so when you abort those requestsÔºå everything goesÔºå you knowÔºå you throw all that work away„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_26.png)

Now„ÄÇü§ß„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇComputer engineers have the superpower that they deploy whenever they run into„ÄÇ

Issues of CPU performance or things not happening fast enough and that superpower is parallelism„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå and„ÄÇThis is what originally happenedÔºå I saidÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 my browser is not loading stuff fast enough down a single TCP connection„ÄÇ

I'm going to just open multiple TCP connections„ÄÇ So now instead of loading all of that web page and allowing the browser to have a single connection to the server„ÄÇ

 I'm going to open four of them at once„ÄÇ I'm going to load four of my pictures at once instead of one„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that turned out to be a really bad idea actually it was great idea„ÄÇ

 it sold a lot of web servers and web browsers at the beginning„ÄÇ

 especially in the day when you were watching the pictures load as your page loaded„ÄÇ

Okay because all of a sudden now oh lookÔºå I remember this day right„ÄÇ

 Mozilla got updated and I was likeÔºå oh great look at this now instead of a single picture loading„ÄÇ

 four of them are loading at the same time it it's going so much faster„ÄÇ

 it actually wasn't going faster at all In factÔºå those four connections were competing with each other for network resources and actually slowing things down„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåBut because it looked to me like four pictures are loading at once„ÄÇ

 it looked like we're going faster„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo insteadÔºå HTTP in version 1„ÄÇ

1 added what we know is connection managementÔºå added the idea that you can have a persistent HTTP connection„ÄÇ

So the actual problem here isn't that we don't have enough connections or something like that„ÄÇ

 the problem is„ÄÇI'm throwing the connection away after I paid all the startup costs after I have the may I connect to you„ÄÇ

 yesÔºå round trip done and after I have done slow startÔºå rightÔºüWhen I get my response„ÄÇ

 I throw all that work away„ÄÇSo instead HtP1 at1 says let's keep that around„ÄÇ

 let's make it persistent so the connection is persistentÔºå we'll leave the connection open„ÄÇ

If we ask for this to happen and then when I need to make my next request I just use the same TCP connection there's no need to once again mother may I connect to you yes you can it's already there let's go ahead and open it up„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_28.png)

OkayÔºå and so this is what it looks like in a persistent connection„ÄÇ

We still have to open the TCP connectionÔºå may I connect to youÔºå yes you may„ÄÇ

 so there's one round trip to do that„ÄÇNow I can request my objectÔºå heyÔºå can I have index do HTML„ÄÇ

 SureÔºå here's index„ÄÇ HTML„ÄÇOkayÔºå and now oh let me look through that oh I'm going to need a css file hey can I have cU„ÄÇ

css here yes you can oh I'm going to need an image can I have that image here„ÄÇ

May I have that image yes you can„ÄÇSo we're going to need a round trip time to start up„ÄÇ

And then we need a roundship time for each request every time I make a request„ÄÇ

 may I have that thingÔºå yesÔºå you canÔºå may have another thingÔºå yes you can„ÄÇAnd so I have„ÄÇ

 this is way betterÔºå rightÔºüA couple slides agoÔºå every request required two round trips plus transport time„ÄÇ

Now I can make a whole bunch of requestsÔºå each of which needs around trip time„ÄÇ

But instead of each of them also needing another round trip time each„ÄÇ

 I have this one request to open the connection that I'm amortizing over manyÔºå many„ÄÇ

 many individual HTTP requests„ÄÇAnd we can go better„ÄÇBecause now I can„ÄÇ

Another thing that computer engineers always do whenever they have the opportunity„ÄÇ

 let's overlap operationsÔºå let's actually pipeline things„ÄÇ

Let me go ahead and I know I need three things from you„ÄÇSo I'm going to open the connectionÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 can I connect to youÔºå yes you can„ÄÇAnd now let me just askÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 can I have this and while you're at it I want that and also I need this other thing„ÄÇ

 so you send all three of the requests„ÄÇAnd the server sends you each response as it goes„ÄÇ

OkayYou don't have to wait around to get the first responseÔºå this first picture here said„ÄÇ

 let's wait around until I get my first response handled before I ask my second„ÄÇHere„ÄÇ

 I'm just going to go ahead and sayÔºå heyÔºå here's my entire laundry list„ÄÇI need milkÔºå eggs„ÄÇ

 and butterÔºå instead of I need milk„ÄÇOnce I get the milk let me ask for eggs„ÄÇ

 let me go ahead and just get all this at once„ÄÇNow one caveat„ÄÇ

 oftentimes this first request is for an HTML page„ÄÇSo when I go ask for index„ÄÇ HmoÔºå at that point„ÄÇ

 I don't know that I need a whole bunch of pictures„ÄÇ

So oftentimes I'll have let me have that HTML page and once I parse that HTML page now I know I need a whole bunch of things and so at this point in time„ÄÇ

Now I'd fire off requests for 10 images in five JavaScript files„ÄÇ

But I can overlap all those if I like„ÄÇ

ü§ß„ÄÇHuge advantages right don't do set up and tear down the seat the server loves it because it doesn't have to manage all those set up and tear down in all that state„ÄÇ

I'm using the TCP connection„ÄÇIn the optimized state now I can actually„ÄÇ

By sending all my data down the same connectionÔºå let that„ÄÇ

Let TCP actually optimize that actual transactionÔºå and so that's going to„ÄÇ

Use the connection quite well„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå a couple minutes left to talk about caching„ÄÇ

 which is something else that was improved in 1„ÄÇ1„ÄÇThis is another one of those superpower things„ÄÇ

 rightÔºüComputer engineers do this all the time if„ÄÇIf I do a bunch of work„ÄÇAnd I get an answer„ÄÇ

Let me save that answer somewhere so that if I ever need to do that work again„ÄÇ

 I don't have to actually do the workÔºå I just look up the answer„ÄÇüò°ÔºåOkay so we do this you know oh„ÄÇ

 memory accesses are expensiveÔºå so once I go off to memory in my computer architecture„ÄÇ

 let me get the results I get back from memory and put them into a cache right our CPUs have usually they have many layers of caches„ÄÇ

They are a mechanism to improve performance by letting us„ÄÇ

Use work I've done in the past if it's reasonable I'll be doing that work again and so a web proxy is a cash mechanism that does the same thing„ÄÇ

So the proxy is a server somewhere that usually is specific to a network„ÄÇ

 so let's say Carnegie Mellon will have this proxy server and the idea is that within the network„ÄÇ

I may have many clients that are going to ask for the same thing„ÄÇ

Maybe all of these clients are going off to CNN to see what the news is and so they're making the same request„ÄÇ

 they're saying hey CNN or heyÔºå you know heyÔºå Wall Street Journal„ÄÇ

 I'd like to see the front page of the Wall Street Journal today and that's the request„ÄÇ

And so those requests flow through the proxy serverÔºå the proxy server makes the request of„ÄÇ

 you know it'll go off and actually go to where the data actually as we call that the origin server„ÄÇ

 it'll go to Wall Street Journal and talk to the web server to get the actual front page and it'll pass that along to whoever asked for it„ÄÇ

 but it'll save a copy„ÄÇSo that if later on there's another request for the front page of the Wall Street Journal„ÄÇ

 we don't have to go talk to the Wall Street Journal anymoreÔºå we can just give them that data„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and if there'sÔºå you knowÔºå if this request comes in the proxy server„ÄÇLooks up and says„ÄÇ

 do I have this and if so let me just give it to you„ÄÇ

 otherwise I'll go talk to some origin server to get it for you„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_34.png)

Now whenever you cache something you have to worry about consistency„ÄÇ

 you've made multiple copies of somethingÔºå what happens if the copies are different and for us that happens because the Wall Street Journal has decided there's breaking news„ÄÇ

Maybe not Wall Street JournalÔºå but the newspaper has decided there's breaking news„ÄÇ

 we need to change what the web page looks like„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and so now what's at the origin server is different from what the proxy server has and so this was the problem with caching under 1„ÄÇ

0 there was no way to communicate these things there was no way to ask„ÄÇ

You know that has the front page been updated again„ÄÇ

 you know should I get a new copy is the copy I have good and so headers were added to the protocol to allow us to specify the expiration of the data so when you go to Wall Street Journal and get that that web object„ÄÇ

You can sayÔºå and how long will this be good for is this good for an hour or for a day or for a week„ÄÇ

 how long can I keep this in my cashÔºüAnd„ÄÇThat means that any request that come in while this data has not expired„ÄÇ

 I don't have to talk to you at all you've basically guaranteed that this data will be good for a week„ÄÇ

And so I can keep it for a week and respond to requests for a week„ÄÇAfter a weekÔºå this data is stale„ÄÇ

 doesn't mean it's changedÔºå it just means maybe I ought to go check again„ÄÇ

And so we'd wanted to be able to know when it's expired we'd also like to have ways to ask is this thing still valid okay I have this copy that's dated at this point in time„ÄÇ

 is it fresh or is it stale„ÄÇOkayÔºå now„ÄÇHttP protocol allows you to ask these questions it doesn't have policy right there's a bunch of cash policies like„ÄÇ

YouIf I if the cache is full I need to throw something away which one do I throw away the protocol is not going to specify that all the protocol has allowed you to do is ask these questions and get the data about the freshness and about the expiration date of our particular objects„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå the the„ÄÇDesigner of the cacheÔºå whoever wrote the cash code is the one who has to answer the policy questions like„ÄÇ

You knowÔºå which object do we evict or you know how do I decideÔºü

should I decide based on popularity or notÔºüYou knowÔºå quit how to replace something„ÄÇ

And so there is this expires header or there's a cache control header that let you lets the server specify„ÄÇ

 and so oftentimes in fact I would be surprised if Wall Street Journal wanted their stuff cached„ÄÇ

 okay normally they're going to sayÔºå ohÔºå max age equals zeroÔºå please do not cache this at all„ÄÇ

OkayI do you know why a newspaper would tell you it did not want stuff cacheed because theyre are constantly updating content„ÄÇ

So that's one of them right they probably are updating content oftenÔºå but they could say half hour„ÄÇ

 rightÔºüüò°ÔºåYeah it's the ad revenue okay they want to be able to prove that their stuff gets read and the only way for them to do it is to or the they have found many ways to do it because they're tracking us all the time in very privacy invasive ways but from this conversation the way to do it is to have your web server count how many connections it's had and then you can go to the ad sales guys and say„ÄÇ

 hey our web server had you know 27 million connections yesterday increase our ad price sort of thing is that true for most guys you think that we could just refresh the browser over and over again and you know get to get a rack up quote unquote you take viewsÔºü

YeahÔºå so„ÄÇThere's there's a bunch of behaviors that will push that one way or the other right i'm sure that they also probably are doing things like unique IP addresses so if you happen to have a friend you who works in marketing at a newspaper and you want to increase their ad sales by just hitting refresh over and over and over again they're probably going to say oh yeah those all came from from your your particular connection so those don't count so that's why we do unique users per month and metrics like that„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_36.png)

ÂóØ„ÄÇValidation is done by asking questions so this is when the cash wants to know it says hey„ÄÇ

 I have this thing is it still good and what we do is there's an if modified sense header that makes our gets conditional I talked about this a little bit earlier and I can say hey„ÄÇ

 I've got the copy from yesterday„ÄÇI'm going to send a get message„ÄÇ

 but I'll tell you I have a copy since yesterdayÔºå and so if it hasn't been modified„ÄÇ

 then you get back a 304 not modified message that does not contain the data„ÄÇ

 it's just a very short header as opposed to if the object has been modified then you get a 200 and the new data with it„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_38.png)

Okay„ÄÇSo last question then will be done for the dayÔºå I've talked a little bit about web proxies„ÄÇ

 which are a server that would be stuck somewhereÔºå let's say CMU has a web proxy server that works as a cache turns out your browser also has a cache so if you refresh a web page you know it may be that not all of that gets refresh because your web browser has decided„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå I have a copy of that JavaScript fileÔºå let me just use that„ÄÇOkayÔºå is so„ÄÇ

Is the web proxy better than your browser cacheÔºüAustinÔºå yesÔºå the browser is closer to the browser„ÄÇ

 it's in the browser„ÄÇDoesn't necessarily mean it's better or worse„ÄÇ

Stepha knows any cash should result in less trafficÔºå so that's good„ÄÇSo Dion is on something„ÄÇ

 the proxy can serve multiple browsersÔºå the proxy is better„ÄÇ

Because it's at CMU and so it's able to serve everybody at CMU that asks the same questionÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 the browser cache is on your browser„ÄÇSo it can't help if Don asks the question„ÄÇ

 my browser cache is not going to respond„ÄÇüò°ÔºåIt helps me if I ask for the same thing over and over„ÄÇ

 it's already thereÔºå okayÔºå but the one at CMU is going to make sure that only one request to New York Times leaves CMU every day and then every other request for the New York Times stays within CMU's network„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåOkayÔºå and so that lets it respond to other clients that are in the same network on the other hand„ÄÇ

So the answer is yes and no„ÄÇThe browser cache is better because it can actually respond to stuff if the network is down or not working and it's actually better for you okay so Austin or whoever that was was correct in that the browser cache is closer to you and so the browser cache is better for you because now you don't have to go talk to us CMU proxy to get an answer to your question it's right in the browser„ÄÇ

No network traffic needed„ÄÇSo it depends„ÄÇ

![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_40.png)

All rightÔºå and here's our lesson objectives for today with thatÔºå we're done with our first„ÄÇProtocol„ÄÇ

 we're not done with the layerÔºå okay we're going to keep talking about application stuff for a while„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåBut we've had our first look at a protocol in the application layer and dug into this is probably the most popular„ÄÇ

 I know we'll talk about DNS next timeÔºå which is another very commonly used protocol in the application layer as well„ÄÇ

Until thenÔºå hope you guys have a great couple daysÔºå we'll see you next time„ÄÇGoodbye„ÄÇBye bye„ÄÇ

eÊôö thank you„ÄÇYeahÔºå good luck if you're going to TOC„ÄÇGo get a jobÔºå get an internship„ÄÇ

Profesor I have a question„ÄÇÂì•‰πüËÆ∏„ÄÇI'm I saying there'„ÄÇYeahÔºå I have a question I said„ÄÇ



![](img/a094a47bc7590797ecbde49c22287b3f_42.png)

So does each computation node like routers in the network has a cash implemented„ÄÇ

Or it's only happened on Web proxy or browsers„ÄÇ NoÔºå yeahÔºå the routers won't have a cache in them„ÄÇ

 in fact„ÄÇYou may recall that the router is a in the pictures I showed actually didn't have any transportation or application layer in them„ÄÇ

 and so that meant the router was just sending packets around so it doesn't even look in theory„ÄÇ

 the routers don't look in the packet to find what the contents are to know that it's an HTTP request„ÄÇ

Okay so in a pure network they would not get involved at all„ÄÇ

 the proxy then is a special server that is put somewhere in the network by the network administrators and they make sure that all the HTTP traffic has to travel through it and that particular proxy now actually has transport and application layer to make this all happen„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå yeahÔºå but not all the routers are doing this just it would be a specific machine that the network administrators have put in place„ÄÇ

Thank you very muchÔºå sure„ÄÇHeyÔºå Jeremy did you have any further questions about administrative stuff or did answer them I think let's see I will„ÄÇ

 I mean the only challenge is so I thank you for askingÔºå by the way„ÄÇ

 this is helpful that let's see fills office hours and your office hours for that matter„ÄÇ

Sorry'm sorryÔºå your office hours are fine so the point is those office hours„ÄÇ

 I have class my I have class from 320 to well„ÄÇIt's a miniÔºå so we'll be over halfway of the semester„ÄÇ

 but the point is for Bills Al I have a class that almost entirely conflicts with that„ÄÇ

 So if I needed to ask him about something else I could„ÄÇI could set up a different time„ÄÇOf course„ÄÇ

YeahÔºå I meanÔºå it may be moreÔºå so if you have a generalÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 how do web proxies work kind of questionÔºüI would I would say especially in your case„ÄÇ

 probably easier to go to a TA during their office hours„ÄÇ

 but certainly you're welcome you know to do thatÔºå but that's going to require a email to me„ÄÇ

 hey BillÔºå can we set up something and a me back you know how's Thursday at two and you know it's not you know that kind of stuff so from a scheduling perspective it just may be easier to go to TA but certainly if you have a specific thing you want to ask me actually„ÄÇ

AnytimeÔºå if you want to talk to meÔºå I'd certainly be happy to talk to you„ÄÇ

Okay thanks yeah okay since I just got on so now i'm just like kind of running through all the stuff I had missed before Okay okay all right so I think that's good I mean i've glimpsed over the Wi sha lab I haven't started it yet but it shouldn't take too long I don't thinks no it's a it's a two hours to sit down and actually do it sort of thing fantastic Okay thanks very much thanks for asking your question about the study groups I think„ÄÇ

As I mentionedÔºå I really think that's a powerful way to study yeahÔºå I mean„ÄÇ

 normally I guess we'd be talking in class with those studentÔºå but if there's like some mechanism„ÄÇ

 maybe I guess I guess I'm close on Piazza or something to try and get some attention but yes yes certainly welcome to I actually I got an email last night that I haven't really responded to or really even read fully about somebody on campus who's saying that there's been a request for a study group in74 I don't know if that was you they may have some way of setting something up so I will hopefully today get to my enormous email inbox and maybe we'll have a piazza post about that as well Okay I mean I didn't send you anything but I'm gonna make a piazza post or write about this right now Yeah sure go for it okay thanks very much Bill certainly„ÄÇ

Ê≤°ÔºåÊãúÊãú„ÄÇ
