- en: Runtime errors refer to those created by unexpected behavior within your code.
    For example, perhaps you intended for a user to input a number, but they input
    a character instead. Your program may throw an error because of this unexpected
    input from the user.

    curly braces as the value of `x`. Further, testing out your code, you can imagine
    how one could easily type in a string or a character instead of a number. Even
    still, a user could type nothing at all – simply hitting the enter key.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, if you examine the order of operations in `x = int(input("What's x?"))`,
    working right to left, it could take an incorrectly inputted character and attempt
    to assign it as an integer. If this fails, the assignment of the value of `x`
    never occurs. Therefore, there is no x to print on our final line of code.

    `else`. Running `python number.py` and supplying `50`, you’ll notice that the
    result will be printed. Trying again, this time supplying `cat`, you’ll notice
    that the program now catches the error.

    If our user does not cooperate, we currently simply end our program. Consider
    how we can use a loop to prompt the user for `x` and if they don’t prompt again!

    a user that inputs something incorrectly will be asked for input again.

    function. Right now, notice that we are relying currently upon the honor system
    that the `x` is in both the `main` and `get_int` functions. We probably want to
    pass in a prompt that the user sees when asked for input. Modify your code as
    follows.
