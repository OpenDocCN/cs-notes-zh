    various files into a single archive. It is similar to a ZIP or tar file. To create

- en: Alternatively, a Java program can directly access resources within a JAR file,
    provided the JAR file is in the classpath. As an example, [cards.jar](cards.jar)
    contains GIF images of the 52 playing cards, and [Card.java](Card.java.html) accesses
    it to display images. Note that you must put the JAR file in your classpath and
    access the resources as URLs.

- en: '**Executable JAR files.** Another use of JAR files is to bundle together all
    of the resources for a program so that a user can download the JAR file and execute
    it (assuming they have the Java runtime environment installed). Here are [instructions](jar/jar.html)
    creating *executable JAR files*. Another option for Windows users is [JSmooth](http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/),
    which makes a standard Windows EXE file from a Java JAR file.'

- en: '**Java Web Start.** Java Web Start is a framework for distributing Java applications
    over the web. Unlike a JAR executable, the client launches an application from
    resources hosted on the Web instead of the local file system. This is useful if
    you want the user to always run the most up-to-date version of the application.
    Here are [instructions](jar/webstart.html) for creating a Java Web Start application.'

- en: '**Applets.** Java applets are automatically downloaded and launched in a Web
    browser and executed in a secure sandbox. One difficulty with applets is that
    certain browsers do not provide support for current versions of Java. Thus, you
    will need to instruct the browser to download an appropriate plugin if it is not
    already installed. `appletviewer`.'
