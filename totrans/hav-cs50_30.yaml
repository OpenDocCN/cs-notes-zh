    of one’s code where one types the same thing over and over again. Imagine where
    one might want to “meow” 500 times. Would it be logical to type that same expression
    of `print("meow")` over and over again?

- en: Notice how even though this code will execute `print("meow")` multiple times,
    it will never stop! It will loop forever. `while` loops work by repeatedly asking
    if the condition of the loop has been fulfilled. In this case, the interpreter
    is asking, “does `i` not equal zero?” When you get stuck in a loop that executes
    forever, you can press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to break out of the loop.

- en: Notice that now our code executes properly, reducing `i` by `1` for each “iteration”
    through the loop. The term iteration has special significance within coding. By
    iteration, we mean one cycle through the loop. The first iteration is the “0th”
    iteration through the loop. The second is the “1st” iteration. In programming,
    we count starting with 0, then 1, then 2.

    to the left. Above, we are starting `i` at one, like most humans count (1, 2,
    3). If you execute the code above, you’ll see it meows three times. It’s best
    practice in programming to begin counting with zero.

    `continue` explicitly tells Python to go to the next iteration of a loop. `break`,
    on the other hand, tells Python to “break out” of a loop early before it has finished
    all of its iterations. In this case, we’ll `continue` to the next iteration of
    the loop when `n` is less than 0—ultimately reprompting the user with “What’s
    n?”. If, though, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, we’ll `break` out of the loop
    and allow the rest of our program to run.
