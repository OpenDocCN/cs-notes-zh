  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Utilizing HTTP, one is vulnerable to *Man-in-the-Middle* attacks where an adversary
    could inject additional HTML code into what one is downloading. Advertisements
    could be injected into all the web pages you are accessing via HTTP. Further,
    malicious code could be inserted as well.
  prefs:

    adversary may look inside data that is being transferred between parties. You
    can imagine how a credit card number placed within an unsecured packet could indeed
    be detected and stolen by an adversary.

    of type *X.509*. These websites also have a private key.

    runs it through an algorithm, and creates a hash.

    redirect traffic to a malicious website. An adversary may even redirect one to
    an HTTPS-secured domain that is not the intended website.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    transport security*, whereby the server tells the browser to direct all traffic
    to a secure connection.

    from the second party, it will appear to services throughout the web that your
    IP address is that of the second party: not your original IP address!'

    one may issue an `ssh` command. The following is an example of using the SSH command

    a network, to prevent outsiders from participating in traffic.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firewalls can also use *deep packet inspection*, where they examine the data
    within packets for material that may be of interest to your company. This can
    be used to check to see if you are emailing the press or other parties that may
    be considered adversaries by your company.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deep packet inspection is used via *proxy*, where a device in the middle is
    used as the path by which traffic comes in an out of the network. It is on this
    proxy that your school or company may change URLs, log what URL you are attempting
    to browse to, and, hopefully, protect you against potentially harmful behavior.

    other computers and can be used by an adversary to issue commands to thousands
    of infected computers.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computers infected by botnets can be used to issue *denial-of-service attacks*
    whereby lots of requests can be issued to a server for the purpose of slowing
    or shutting it down. Because so many computers are in a botnet, this type of attack
    can be called *distributed denial-of-service attacks* from thousands of IP addresses.
