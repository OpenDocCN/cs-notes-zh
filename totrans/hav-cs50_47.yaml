    a team at [MIT’s Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/) and now
    maintained by its own [Scratch Foundation](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits).

  prefs:

    sprite to the right, and negative x-values will move it to the left. Similarly,
    positive y-values will move the sprite up, and negative y-values will move it
    down.
