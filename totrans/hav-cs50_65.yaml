    is the part of the screen that is actually visible to the user at any given time.

    known as a [flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp). This allows
    us to easily have elements wrap around to the next line if they don’t fit horizontally.
    We do this by putting all of our elements in a `div` that we’ll call our container.
    We then add some styling to that div specifying that we want to use a flexbox
    display for the elements inside of it. We’ve also added some additional styling
    to the inner divs to better illustrate the wrapping that’s occuring here.

    In this file, we can create a new variable by adding a `$` before a name, then
    a colon, then a value. For example, we would write `$color: red` to set the variable
    color to the value red. We then access that variable using `$color`. Here’s an
    example of our variables.scss file:'

    `.scss` file because most web browsers only recognize `.css` files. To deal with
    this problem, we have to [download a program called Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)
    onto our computers. Then, in our terminal, we write `sass variables.scss:variables.css`
    This command will compile a .scss file named `variables.scss` into a .css file
    named `variables.css`, to which you can add a link in your HTML page.

    which automatically changes the `.css` file every time a change is detected in
    the `.scss` file.

    CSS selectors we talked about earlier. For example, if we want to apply some styling
    only to paragraphs and unordered lists within a div, we can write the following:'

- en: One more feature that Sass gives us is known as [inheritance](https://sass-lang.com/guide).
    This allows us to create a basic set of styling that can be shared by several
    different elements. We do this by adding a `%` before a name of a class, adding
    some styling, and then later adding the line `@extend %classname` to the beginning
    of some styling. For example, the following code applies the styling within the
    `message` class to each of the different classes below, resulting in a webpage
    that looks like the one below.
