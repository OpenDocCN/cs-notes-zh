- en: Java includes a vast number of libraries that have been designed and implemented
    by experts. Even more general-purpose libraries are available from the Web for
    download. Many of the data structures and algorithms we have considered already
    (binary heaps, binary search trees, hash tables, quicksort) play a central role
    in these libraries. Avoid re-inventing wheel. Knowing how to find the right library
    and interface with it is a useful skill.

    integers, including addition, multiplication, modular arithmetic, primality testing,
    prime number generation, and bit manipulations. This class is useful for implementing
    various cryptographic schemes including RSA.'

- en: '**StringBuffer.** There are two built-in classes for manipulating strings:
    String and StringBuffer. The first is used to store an *immutable* sequence of
    characters, i.e., a string whose value will never change. The second is to store
    a string whose characters may be modified. Behind the scenes, the compiler uses
    a StringBuffer to perform any concatenations operations, e.g., s = "Hello " +
    "World".'

- en: A common performance bug is to concatenate a sequence of characters (or words)
    together, one at a time, to form a long string. The following code illustrates
    the problem.

- en: A problem arises because each time the new character c is appended to s, a new
    copy of s is created since strings are immutable. It can take time proportional
    to N^2 to construct a string of length N. Instead, you should use a StringBuffer
    so that the time is proportional to N.

- en: '**Packages.** There are many times when no available library fits your needs.
    In this case, you must create your own library. In Java, there is a built-in mechanism
    called a *package* that organizes related classes so that it can be accessed just
    like the built-in system libraries. To build a package named `Jama`, you must
    include the statement `import Jama;` at the beginning of the client program. The
    classes in the Jama package must be stored in a subdirectory named `Jama`. The
    parent directory must be in your CLASSPATH, e.g., the current directory.'

    directly in to Java. For example, if you want to parse web documents in HTML,
    you might want to use [HTMLParser v 1.3](http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/).
    Example applications: web crawling, extracting text content. Explain how to download
    an external library as a .jar file and use it.'
