    includes the argument `end='\n'`. This `\n` indicates that the `print` function
    will automatically create a line break when run. The function takes an argument
    called `end`, and the default is to create a new line.

- en: You can imagine many scenarios where you don’t just want a function to perform
    an action but also to return a value back to the main function. For example, rather
    than simply printing the calculation of `x + y`, you may want a function to return
    the value of this calculation back to another part of your program. This “passing
    back” of a value we call a `return` value.

    returned back to the main function.
