<h2 id="securing-data">Securing Data</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">This is CS50’s Introduction to Cybersecurity.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Last week, recall we focused on accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">We focused on our responsibility to keep our data secure.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">However, a third party is always involved in the storing of our data.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You can imagine how a system may store usernames and passwords within a text file.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You can also imagine how an adversary may get access to such a text file.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Could we minimize the risk of storing passwords in plain text?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Hashing</em> is a method by which we convert some plain text and output it as a hashed value that is less readable.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Therefore, a <em>hash function</em> creates a hash value. A password is provided to a hash function and then is outputted as a hashed value.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Without access to the precise hash function, an adversary cannot output the correct password.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Generally, we want the hash function to output something very cryptic and lacking a pattern. Accordingly, adversaries cannot guess what the algorithm is doing.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">With the username and hash values stored in the server, an adversary cannot easily access the accounts on that server.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">When a user now inputs their password to log in, the password is passed to the hash algorithm again and compares the hash value created with the hash value stored.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Hence, we have increased the cost, time, and resources required for an adversary to access protected data.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Still, a <em>dictionary attack</em> could input one value after another from a dictionary into a hash function as a way by which to break it.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Further, a <em>brute-force attack</em> could attempt to sequentially feed one character after another to attempt to break the password.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Hypothetically, <em>rainbow tables</em> are another threat, whereby the adversary has a table of all the potential hashed values in a hash table. This, however, would take terabytes, if not petabytes, of storage capacity to accomplish.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Finally, a problem arises when users utilize the same password and the hashed value of these passwords is exactly the same. How could we solve this problem?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="salting">Salting</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Salting</em> is a process by which an added value is “sprinkled” into the hash function, such that a hash value changes.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">The utilization of a salt value nearly guarantees that the hash values provided by users, even those that have the same passwords, receive a different hashed password.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Therefore, again, the cost for adversaries to crack these passwords is quite costly.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">NIST recommends that memorized secrets be both hashed and salted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-way-hash-functions">One-Way Hash Functions</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>One-way hash functions</em> are written in code and take in a string of arbitrary length and output a hash of a fixed length.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Utilizing such a function, the holder of the hash value and hash function will never know the original password.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Indeed, in some systems utilizing a one-way hash function, certain passwords may map to the same hash value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="codes">Codes</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Cryptography is the study of transmitting secure data from one party to another.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">One way we can secure data is through codes.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Codes convert the words we want to say into a less understandable string of words.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Encoding</em> involves taking plaintext and converting them into codetext.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Decoding</em> is the opposite, converting codetext into plaintext.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ciphers">Ciphers</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Ciphering involves taking plaintext and <em>enciphering</em> them into ciphertext.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">This process of ciphering is called <em>encryption</em>. The process of deciphering them is called <em>decryption</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Keys are really big strings. These keys are used in encryption and decryption.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Secret-key cryptography</em> involves the passing of a key and plaintext into an encryption algorithm, where ciphertext is outputted.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">In this scenario, both the sender and receiver have a shared secret with one another in that they both have access to the encryption and decryption algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cryptanalysis">Cryptanalysis</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Cryptanalysis</em> is the field of study and practice where individuals study how to encrypt and decrypt data.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">By evidence of your being part of this course, you, too, may be interested in cryptanalysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="public-key-cryptography">Public-Key Cryptography</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">You can imagine a scenario where the sender and receiver of secure data may have never personally met. How can one establish a shared secret between two such parties?</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Public-key encryption</em> or <em>asymmetric-key encryption</em> solves this problem.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">First, the sender uses a public key and plaintext and feeds these into an algorithm. This results in ciphertext.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Second, the receiver uses their secret key, feeding in both this secret key and ciphertext into the algorithm. This results in deciphered text.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>RSA</em> is a standard of encryption that describes this process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-exchange">Key Exchange</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">An alternative algorithm is called <em>Diffie-Hellman</em>, the goal of which is key exchange.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">An agreed upon value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> and a prime value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p</code> are used.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Party A and Party B have a shared secret value called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Both Party A and Party B have their own private keys.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Using the building blocks of public keys and private keys, you can use these to sign documents.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">One can <em>sign</em> a document through a two-step process.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">First, a message, the content of a document, is passed to a hash function, resulting in a hash value.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Second, a private key and a hash are passed to a digital signature algorithm, which results in a digital signature.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">The recipient is able to <em>verify</em> your digital signature by passing the message, the content of the document, to the hash function and receiving a hash. Then, the recipient passes the public key and the signature provided to the decryption algorithm, resulting in a hash value that should match the hash value previously calculated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="passkeys">Passkeys</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Passkeys</em> or <em>WebAuthn</em> are a more and more widely available technology.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Soon, usernames and passwords will become less frequent.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Passkeys will be device-dependent. For example, when visiting a website on your phone that prompts you to create an account, your phone will generate a public key and a private key.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Then, you will send your public key to the website.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">From that point forward, to log into the website using that device, or a service that synchronises your passkeys across devices, you will pass a private key paired with a challenge value. An algorithm will produce a signature.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="encryption-in-transit">Encryption in Transit</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Encryption in transit</em> relates to securing data as it moves back and forth through data networks.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Imagine a scenario where two parties want to communicate with one another.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">We want to prevent a third party from intercepting data in between.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Third-party services–like email providers–that function as intermediaries may indeed be reading your emails or viewing your messages.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>End-to-end encryption</em> is a way by which users can guarantee that no third party in between can read the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deletion">Deletion</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Let’s now consider a fairly mundane scenario, like deleting a file.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Once files are deleted on a computer, a fingerprint of those deleted files may still be on your computer.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Operating systems often delete files by simply <em>forgetting</em> where they exist. Hence, the computer may overwrite previous files with new files.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">However, there is no guarantee that the free space on your hard drive is entirely wiped off the fingerprints of old files.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Secure deletion</em> is a process by which all the remnants of deleted files are changed to zeroes, ones, or a random sequence of zeros and ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="full-disk-encryption">Full-Disk Encryption</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Full-disk encryption</em> or <em>encryption at rest</em> entirely encrypts the content of your hard drive.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">If your device is stolen or you sell your device, no one will have access to your encrypted data.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">However, a downside is that if you lose your password or your face changes enough, you will not have access to your data.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Another downside is that hackers may use this same type of technology through <em>ransomware</em> to encrypt your hard drive and hold it hostage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*"><em>Quantum computing</em> is an emerging computer technology that may be able to provide exponential computing power to adversaries.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">This technology may be used by adversaries to cut down on the time required to guess passwords and break encryption.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Hopefully, we will have access to such computing power before bad actors do.</li>
</ul>
