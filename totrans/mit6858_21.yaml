    messages under an assumed name. In order to remain anonymous, he decides to use
    Tor to log into the account. He installs Tor on his computer (from a trusted source)
    and enables it, launches Firefox, types in www.twitter.com into his browser, and

    tracking, he deletes all cookies, HTML5 client-side storage, history, etc. from
