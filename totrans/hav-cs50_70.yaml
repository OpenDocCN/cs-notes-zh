    how to use Git and GitHub in order to keep track of changes to our code and collaborate
    with others. We also familiarized ourselves with the Python programming language,
    started using Django to create web applications, and learned how to use Django
    models to store information in our sites.

    First, just as we try to avoid in-line styling with CSS, we want to avoid in-line
    JavaScript as much as possible. We can do this in our counter example by adding
    a line of script that changes the `onclick` attribute of a button on the page,
    and removing the `onclick` attribute from within the `button` tag.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE13]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: One thing to notice about what we’ve just done is that we’re not calling the
    `count` function by adding parentheses afterward, but instead just naming the
    function. This specifies that we only wish to call this function when the button
    is clicked. This works because, like Python, JavaScript supports functional programming,
    so functions can be treated as values themselves.

    To account for this, we can specify that code will run only after the page has

    Amazon, or some weather service. We can do this by making calls to a service’s
    API, which will return structured data to us, often in [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
    (JavaScript Object Notation) form. For example, a flight in JSON form might look
    like this:'

    application where we can find exchange rates between two currencies. Throughout
    the exercise, we’ll be using the [European Central Bank’s Exchange Rate API](https://exchangeratesapi.io).
    By visiting their website, you’ll see the API’s documentation, which is generally
    a good place to start when you wish to use an API. We can test this api by visiting
    the URL: [https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD).
    When you visit this page, you’ll see the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar
    and many other currencies, written in JSON form. You can also change the GET parameter
    in the URL from `USD` to any other currency code to change the rates you get.'

    or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, which allows us to access information from
    external pages even after our page has loaded. In order to do this, we’ll use
    the [fetch](https://javascript.info/fetch) function which will allow us to send
    an HTTP request. The `fetch` function returns a [promise](https://web.dev/promises/).
    We won’t talk about the details of what a promise is here, but we can think of
    it as a value that will come through at some point, but not necessarily right
    away. We deal with promises by giving them a `.then` attribute describing what
    should be done when we get a `response`. The code snippet below will log our response
    to the console.

    always a function. Although it seems we are creating the variables `response`
    and and `data`, those variables are just the parameters of two anonymous functions.
