    our great hope is that you *learned how to program* in them all, regardless of
    the language.

    to take input, process it through an algorithm, and produce some output. To that
    point, we played a game where we drew a picture using verbal instructions.

    level*, like the different programming languages utilized in this course.

    when you had to refine your code to do exactly as you wanted.

    is similar to how we abstracted away code into functions.

    Above all, though, you learned how to teach yourself.

    that is of your specification and design. We hope you will join us for the [CS50
    Hackathon](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/fall/hackathon/), an epic all-nighter
    wherein we work together on our final projects.
