<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Over these past ten weeks, you have been drinking from the proverbial firehose.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">During this course, you learned to program in many different languages; indeed, our great hope is that you <em>learned how to program</em> in them all, regardless of the language.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Consider back to the beginning of the course when you worked on Mario: You have come so far and have gained so many skills.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">You should measure your success as the delta between your skill at the start of the course and your skill now, at the end of the course.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Further, we hope that you <em>learned how to solve problems</em> above all else, how to take input, process it through an algorithm, and produce some output. To that point, we played a game where we drew a picture using verbal instructions.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Notice how some verbal instructions were <em>higher level</em> and others were <em>lower level</em>, like the different programming languages utilized in this course.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Notice how some instructions were more specific than others. Remember times when you had to refine your code to do exactly as you wanted.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Also, notice how some instructions were abstracted away, like <em>draw arms</em>. This is similar to how we abstracted away code into functions.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Looking at all the weeks of the course, you gathered tools and built skills. Above all, though, you learned how to teach yourself.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Your final project is your opportunity to build a project, using these skills, that is of your specification and design. We hope you will join us for the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/fall/hackathon/">CS50 Hackathon</a>, an epic all-nighter wherein we work together on our final projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">As you journey from the work of this course to the world outside CS50, you may want to take a number of steps to prepare and adventure out.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Journeying on, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">download</a> and <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/cs50.dev/">learn</a> about VS Code.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">To be able to execute commands on the terminal, much like you did on <a href="https://cs50.dev">CS50.dev</a>, install command-line tools on your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Mac</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">PC</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Learn more about <a href="https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A">Git</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Host a website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">If applicable, host a web app using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/">Azure</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edu/students">Google Cloud</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Ask questions in relevant online communities.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Ask questions using AI-based tools like <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Take any of our other <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/courses/">CS50 courses</a>.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Join one of our many <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/communities">communities</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we reflected on your journey through this course. Specifically, we encourage you to…</p>
<ul>
  <li data-marker="*">Take the programming skills you learned in this course to solve problems in the world.</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Take the new skills you acquired in this course and continue your learning!</li>
  <li data-marker="*">Finish strong and submit your final project.</li>
  <li data-marker="*"><a href="https://youtu.be/DLzxrzFCyOs?si=PC0oK7Pv_NkO4FmX">Quack!</a></li>
