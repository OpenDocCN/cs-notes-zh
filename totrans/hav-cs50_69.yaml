- en: A race condition is a situation that occurs when multiple queries to a database
    occur simultaneously. When these are not adequately handled, problems can arise
    in the precise times that databases are updated. For example, let’s say I have
    $150 in my bank account. A race condition could occur if I log into my bank account
    on both my phone and my laptop, and attempt to withdraw $100 on each device. If
    the bank’s software developers did not deal with race conditions correctly, then
    I may be able to withdraw $200 from an account with only $150 in it. One potential
    solution for this problem would be locking the database. We could not allow any
    other interaction with the database until one transaction has been completed.
    In the bank example, after clicking navigating to the “Make a Withdrawl” page
    on my computer, the bank might not allow me to navigate to that page on my phone.
