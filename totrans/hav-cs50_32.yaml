    in your program.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside the `random` module, there is a built-in function called `random.choice(seq)`.
    `random` is the module you are importing. Inside that module, there is the `choice`
    function. That function takes into it a `seq` or sequence that is a list.
