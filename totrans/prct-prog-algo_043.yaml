- en: At this point we know what a computer is and how it is built. We also know how
    to write Java programs to solve interesting problems. In this section, we'll connect
    these two ideas by "demystifying the Java abstraction." Details about data representation,
    including linked lists and objects; compilers, interpreters, and virtual machines;
    memory and process management; OS, networks and common apps like word processors
    and browsers.

    We describe the basic components of computer systems that support programming;
    operating systems for interacting with our programs and our data; networks that
    allow interaction among computers; and applications systems that provide specialized
    support for particular tasks.'
