    a number. Looking at the environment, notice how the values for `mario` and others

    be numbers to be added together with `+`.

    these mean infinite, negatively infinite, not a number, and null (or none) value.

    column, a value of `1`, `2`, and `3`, coincided with specific possible answers.
    For example, `1` might represent “Yes”.'

    answers. For example, we can use `factor` to change the number `1` to correspond
    to the text “Yes”. We can accomplish this by modifying our code as follows:'
