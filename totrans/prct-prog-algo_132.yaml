    the bivariate EGF with $u$ marking the number of leaves is the solution to $$T(z,u)=uz+z(e^{T(z,u)}-1).$$
    Then show that the mean number of leaves in a random Cayley tree is asymptotic
    to $ne^{-1}$ and, more generally, that the mean number of nodes of outdegree $k$
    in a random Cayley tree of size $n$ is asymptotic to $$n\cdot e^{-1}\, {1\over
    k!}.$$ Degrees are thus approximately described by a Poisson law of rate 1.'

    decimal with digit 1 used once, with digit 2 used twice, ..., with digit 9 used
    nine times. Such numbers all have 45 digits. Compute their sum $S$ and discover,
    much to your amazement that $S$ equals `45875559600006153219084769286399999999999999954124440399993846780915230713600000.`
    This number has a long run of nines (and further nines are hidden!). Is there
    a simple explanation? This exercise is inspired by the Indian mathematician Bhaskara
    Acharya who discovered multinomial coefficients near 1150 AD.'

    of the digits in a random ternary (base 3) number with $N$ digits. For $N=1$,

    this question is to test your understanding of the technique.'

    bits. For example, the string 11010100001 has 7 runs, with lengths 2, 1, 1, 1,
    1, 4, 1 respectively. What is the average number of runs in a random binary string
    of length $N$? List the corresponding horizontal and vertical OBGFs. Is the distribution
    of the number of runs in binary strings concentrated?

    \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. For example, the unit 0-hypercube is a point, and the unit
    3-hypercube is the unit cube. Define a *$k$-face* of the unit $n$-hypercube to
    be a copy of the $k$-hypercube in the exterior of the $n$-hypercube. More formally,
    a $k$-face of the unit $n$-hypercube is a set of the form $\prod_{1\le i\le n}S_i$
    where $S_i$ is either $\{0\}$, $\{1\}$, or $[0, 1]$ for each $i$ between $1$ and
    $n$ and there are exactly $k$ indices $i$ such that $S_i = [0, 1]$. Derive a combinatorial
    construction leading to an OBGF and an explicit formula for the number of $k$-faces
    in the unit $n$-hypercube. Use the OBGF to derive the expected value of the dimension
    a random face of the unit $n$-hypercube.
