    tools we can use to create some basic web pages. Today, we’ll be learning about
    using Git and GitHub to help us in developing web programming applications.

    local (stored on your computer).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One problem that can emerge when working with Git, especially when you’re collaborating
    with other people, is something called a **merge conflict**. A merge conflict
    occurs when two people attempt to change a file in ways that conflict with each
    other.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This will typically occur when you either `git push` or `git pull`. When this
    happens, Git will automatically change the file into a format that clearly outlines
    what the conflict is. Here’s an example where the same line was added in two different
    ways:'

    = 3`, and now we must choose one of those to keep. The long number is a *hash*
    that represents the commit that is conflicting with your edits. Many text editors
    will also provide highlighting and simple options such as “accept current” or
    “accept incoming” that save you the time of deleting the added lines above.

    code, and want to revert back without changing the new feature. This is where
    branching can become really useful.

    by the people who run the Bootsrap repository. This process of people making a
