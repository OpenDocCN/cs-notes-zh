  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We focused on our responsibility to keep our data secure.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a third party is always involved in the storing of our data.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can imagine how a system may store usernames and passwords within a text
    file.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also imagine how an adversary may get access to such a text file.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Could we minimize the risk of storing passwords in plain text?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hashing
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Hashing* is a method by which we convert some plain text and output it as
    a hashed value that is less readable.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, a *hash function* creates a hash value. A password is provided to
    a hash function and then is outputted as a hashed value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without access to the precise hash function, an adversary cannot output the
    correct password.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, we want the hash function to output something very cryptic and lacking
    a pattern. Accordingly, adversaries cannot guess what the algorithm is doing.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the username and hash values stored in the server, an adversary cannot
    easily access the accounts on that server.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a user now inputs their password to log in, the password is passed to the
    hash algorithm again and compares the hash value created with the hash value stored.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, we have increased the cost, time, and resources required for an adversary
    to access protected data.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, a *dictionary attack* could input one value after another from a dictionary
    into a hash function as a way by which to break it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, a *brute-force attack* could attempt to sequentially feed one character
    after another to attempt to break the password.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hypothetically, *rainbow tables* are another threat, whereby the adversary has
    a table of all the potential hashed values in a hash table. This, however, would
    take terabytes, if not petabytes, of storage capacity to accomplish.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, a problem arises when users utilize the same password and the hashed
    value of these passwords is exactly the same. How could we solve this problem?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Salting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Salting* is a process by which an added value is “sprinkled” into the hash
    function, such that a hash value changes.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The utilization of a salt value nearly guarantees that the hash values provided
    by users, even those that have the same passwords, receive a different hashed
    password.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, again, the cost for adversaries to crack these passwords is quite
    costly.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: One-Way Hash Functions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*One-way hash functions* are written in code and take in a string of arbitrary
    length and output a hash of a fixed length.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Utilizing such a function, the holder of the hash value and hash function will
    never know the original password.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, in some systems utilizing a one-way hash function, certain passwords
    may map to the same hash value.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Codes convert the words we want to say into a less understandable string of
    words.
  prefs:

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ciphers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ciphering involves taking plaintext and *enciphering* them into ciphertext.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This process of ciphering is called *encryption*. The process of deciphering
    them is called *decryption*.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keys
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Secret-key cryptography* involves the passing of a key and plaintext into
    an encryption algorithm, where ciphertext is outputted.'
  prefs:

    another in that they both have access to the encryption and decryption algorithm.

- en: Public-Key Cryptography
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can imagine a scenario where the sender and receiver of secure data may
    have never personally met. How can one establish a shared secret between two such
    parties?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Public-key encryption* or *asymmetric-key encryption* solves this problem.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the sender uses a public key and plaintext and feeds these into an algorithm.
    This results in ciphertext.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the receiver uses their secret key, feeding in both this secret key
    and ciphertext into the algorithm. This results in deciphered text.
  prefs:

    exchange.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An agreed upon value `g` and a prime value `p` are used.
  prefs:

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the building blocks of public keys and private keys, you can use these
    to sign documents.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One can *sign* a document through a two-step process.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, a message, the content of a document, is passed to a hash function, resulting
    in a hash value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, a private key and a hash are passed to a digital signature algorithm,
    which results in a digital signature.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recipient is able to *verify* your digital signature by passing the message,
    the content of the document, to the hash function and receiving a hash. Then,
    the recipient passes the public key and the signature provided to the decryption
    algorithm, resulting in a hash value that should match the hash value previously
    calculated.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passkeys
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Passkeys* or *WebAuthn* are a more and more widely available technology.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Soon, usernames and passwords will become less frequent.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passkeys will be device-dependent. For example, when visiting a website on your
    phone that prompts you to create an account, your phone will generate a public
    key and a private key.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, you will send your public key to the website.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From that point forward, to log into the website using that device, or a service
    that synchronises your passkeys across devices, you will pass a private key paired
    with a challenge value. An algorithm will produce a signature.

    through data networks.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine a scenario where two parties want to communicate with one another.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once files are deleted on a computer, a fingerprint of those deleted files may
    still be on your computer.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Operating systems often delete files by simply *forgetting* where they exist.
    Hence, the computer may overwrite previous files with new files.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there is no guarantee that the free space on your hard drive is entirely
    wiped off the fingerprints of old files.
  prefs:

- en: If your device is stolen or you sell your device, no one will have access to
    your encrypted data.
  prefs:

    you will not have access to your data.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
