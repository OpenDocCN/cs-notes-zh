- en: A *circuit* is an interconnected network of *wires*, *power connections*, and
    *controlled switches* that transforms values on input wires to values on output
    wires. In our two-dimensional geometric representation, wires correspond to line
    segments drawn in the plane; controlled switches to wires that cross in a particular
    manner; and circuits to wires drawn within a rectangle. We encapsulate circuits
    by drawing the rectangle that defines the circuit boundary. Inputs are wires that
    terminate at the boundary; outputs stick out past the boundary.

- en: Wires connect to power, carry values, and connect to circuit elements. Some
    of the wires are designated as *inputs*; some others are designated as *outputs*.
    Each wire is always in one of two states (0 or 1). Wires that are connected must
    have the same value. When we trace the values of wires in a circuit, we represent
    those with value 1 with thick lines and those with value 0 with thin lines.

    a connection to that input anywhere within a circuit. A wire connected to a power
    dot has the value 1, unless that connection is broken.

- en: A *controlled switch* is a place in a circuit where a *switch control line*
    crosses another wire and then ends. A change in the value of the switch control
    line can break the connection to power in the wire it crosses, thereby changing
    the value of that wire.

- en: '*On/off switches.* An *on/off switch* is a wire connected to a power source
    (1) that is crossed by a switch control line. If the switch control line value
    is 0, the output wire value is 1; if the control line value is 1, the output wire
    value is 0.'

- en: '*Input/off switches.* More generally, we can think of a controlled switch as
    having an arbitrary input value (not necessarily 1). Logically, the operation
    of the switch is simple: if the switch control line is 0, then the input and output
    wires are connected and therefore have the same value (both 0 or both 1); if the
    switch control line is 1, then the input and output wires are not connected and
    therefore the value of the output wire is 0 (no matter what the value of the input
    wire).'

    which attracts a small piece of wire that can connect the input wire to the output
    wire, but is also connected to a spring. If the electromagnet is off, the spring
    keeps the input connected to the output; if the electromagnet is on, it exerts
    a stronger force than the spring to pull the connecting piece so as to break the
    connection between input and output.'
