    $A$ and $B$ (also classically called "urns"). There are $N$ distinguishable balls,
    and, initially, chamber $A$ contains them all. At any instant $\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},\ldots$,
    one ball is allowed to change from one chamber to the other. Let $E_{n}^{[\ell]}$
    be the number of possible evolutions that lead to chamber $A$ containing $\ell$
    balls at instant $n$ and $E^{[\ell]}(z)$ the corresponding EGF. Show that $$ E^{[\ell]}(z)=\binom{N}{\ell}(\cosh
    z)^\ell (\sinh z)^{N-\ell}, \qquad E^{[N]}(z)=(\cosh z)^N\equiv 2^{-N}(e^z+e^{-z})^N.
    $$ [Hint: the EGF $E^{[N]}$ enumerates mappings where each preimage has an even
    cardinality.] In particular, show that the probability that urn $A$ is again full
    at time $2n$ is $$ \frac{1}{2^NN^{2n}}\sum_{k=0}^{N} \binom{N}{k}(N-2k)^{2n}.
    $$ This famous model was introduced by Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest in 1907, as
    a simplified model of heat transfer. It helped resolve the apparent contradiction
    between irreversibility in thermodynamics (the case $N\to\infty$) and recurrence
    of systems undergoing ergodic transformations (the case $N'
